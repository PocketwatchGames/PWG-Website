				<h2>We're Pocketwatch Games</h2>
				<p>
					Pocketwatch Games was founded in 2005 by Andy Schatz. Andy is the lead
					designer, writer, and producer for the company, and he writes quite a
					bit of game code too.
				</p>
				<p>
					CTO Joseph Riedel joined Pocketwatch to build our proprietary engine,
					'Daedalus', for our upcoming untitled project. Joseph was previously
					instrumental in building the Disney+ streaming platform and survival
					game '7 days to Die'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pocketwatch's debut titles were the IGF Grand Prize nominated
					ecosystem-sim game Wildlife Tycoon: Venture Africa and the subsequent
					game Venture Arctic.
				</p>
				<p>
					2010 was the company's breakout year when the indie co-op heist game
					Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine won the Grand Prize and Excellence in
					Design in the Independent Games Festival, and going on to sell close
					to 2 million copies on PC, Mac, Linux, Xbox, and Switch.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2017, Pocketwatch released Tooth and Tail, an Arcade-Style Real
					Time Strategy game set in a world of animal revolution. Tooth and Tail
					was nominated for numerous awards, including the 2018 IGF award for
					Excellence in Narrative, and still maintains an active community of
					enthusiasts and modders.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pocketwatch is currently working on Monaco 2 and streaming development
					live on Twitch Tuesday-Friday from 11AM-4PM PT.
