title: "The Architect's Patch: Shorter, Better, and Unflinchingly Cut"
---

<p><span>I've never met a game developer that didn't have things they would have liked to have fixed post-release. &nbsp;Monaco's Level Designer, Andy Nguyen, had a ton of them. &nbsp;This big (free) content update is for him.</span></p>

<p>Featuring:</p>
<ul><li><span>Original Campaigns streamlined, huge parts of our least favorite levels unflinchingly slashed</span></li>
<li><span>New features, such as key-doors and ass-cash retconned into the original 2 campaigns</span></li>
<li><span>A new campaign strip with 3 PvP missions, automatically unlocked</span></li>
<li><span>Fresh Leaderboards for both Zombie mode and Enhanced mode</span></li>
</ul><p><strong>Wait, You Made it Shorter?</strong></p>
<p>We sure did. &nbsp;Why?</p>
<ul><li><span>Monaco is a BIG game. &nbsp;Depending on your skill level, anywhere from 20-50 hours to finish both campaigns.</span></li>
<li><span>The final missions of both campaigns have twist endings that people invariably love.</span></li>
</ul><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We call this chart our&nbsp;<em>attrition rate</em>. &nbsp;It shows the number of leaderboard entries per level. &nbsp;The first downward slope is for the first campaign, the second one is for the Lookout's Campaign. &nbsp;Our goal is get both curves as flat as possible.</p>

<p>About 9.4% of people that finished the first level also finished the last level of the first campaign.</p>
<p>About 1.7% finished the last level of the second campaign.</p>
<p><span>The following data is play time, as recorded by Steam.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>We want more people to finish the campaigns, and we also personally kinda hate some of the levels. &nbsp;Certain areas feel redundant, certain levels feel tedious.</p>
<p>Do you remember hating these parts?</p>
<ul><li><span>Both boat levels with the dogs, crossbows, and fire</span></li>
<li><span>Second floor of the hospital (the one that winds around amongst exam rooms)</span></li>
<li><span>The giant, hard, palace level</span></li>
</ul><p><span>We did too!</span></p>
<p>In addition to cutting major parts of these, every level has seen some streamlining with this patch. &nbsp;Don't worry, if you liked the old levels, they are still available if you play "Classic" mode, rather than "Enhanced".</p>
<p>We also improved some elements of the "learning" phase of the game. &nbsp;See these screenshots of the rec yard in the first level.</p>

<p>We've discovered a few things about the prison tutorial: People don't know how to escape guards (break LOS), and they have misconceptions about hiding in bushes (it only works if the guard isn't already attacking you). &nbsp;So we removed the bushes from this level entirely and added an LOS blocker so as to hammer home the point that you need to break LOS.</p>
<p>Don't forget that we also added in a bunch more features into the two campaigns as well, to keep things fresh for our hardcore fans! &nbsp;We've also added individual leaderboards for Zombie mode and Enhanced mode, so if you wanna compete on the boards, they will be fresh and yours for the taking!</p>
<p>So, that's it! &nbsp;I hope you enjoy yet another big free update to Monaco! &nbsp;Maybe one of these days we'll make it perfect.</p>
