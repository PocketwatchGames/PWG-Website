title: "Hey Andy Whatcha Playin'? - Aces Wild: Manic Brawling Action!"
---

<p><span>Hey folks, <strong>Andy Nguyen</strong> here!</span></p>
<p><span>Schatz and I will take turns talking about what we&rsquo;ve been playing in a temporarily titled feature called &ldquo;Hey Andy Whatcha Playin&rsquo;?&rdquo; (name was totally Schatz's idea)</span></p>
<p><span></span>These features are intended to be discussions of other game designs and the emotions they offer, rather than a game review.</p>
<p><span></span>So out of curiosity, I recently played &ldquo;Aces Wild: Manic Brawling Action!&rdquo; since it looked like it could scratch an itch I've been having. I'm a fan of brawlers and fighting games so I was pumped to try this, but what surprised me was it evoked an emotion from earlier era in my life.</p>

<p><strong><!-- more -->Movement as a constant strategic choice</strong></p>
<p><span>The appeal of Aces Wild was very clear to me, it looked like frantic 2D brawler with some unique twists such as the agility of the aerial movement. You&rsquo;re given multiple movement abilities, like air dashes, dodges, and mid-air jumps in addition to the ability&nbsp;to flow through the air in any direction you press while performing combos.</span></p>
<p><span></span>Mobility is a huge part of the game&rsquo;s moment to moment decision making. In classic brawlers, gameplay can result in repetition of a string of commands or an exercise in execution, whereas in Aces Wild, there is a constant strategic choice of how we avoid the threats on the battlefield during combat. Think bullet hell with brawling.</p>
<p><strong>Absence of a combo counter in place of a meter</strong></p>
<p>Another major design decision that stuck out to me was the absence of a combo counter. Traditionally, games often place a large number on the side of the screen that increases for every successful subsequent hit. The argument can be made that this number is often arbitrary and only serves as an extrinsic reward.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/img/2014-02-12-hey-andy-whatcha-playin---aces-wild-manic-brawling-action\9d1782e5204984e74179b50f3539dcf2f886b8d599eb935ef63938a64bdee4d2.png" /></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Ace&rsquo;s gameplay revolves around the constant choice of risk and reward, given how you manage a resource meter. As you complete combos in the game, the meter fills up, which will increase enemy damage and aggression, as well as grant you additional abilities and damage. Use those abilities however, and the meter depletes. This meter not only serves as the game&rsquo;s equivalent to a combo counter, gauging your success in combat, but also as a resource that the player will constantly manage.</span></p>
<p><strong>Improvisational learning and controlled chaos</strong></p>
<p>The strategic mobility and combo meter in Aces Wild immediately reminded me of a game I was so passionate about years ago.</p>
<p>For several years, I was active in the fighting game community, going to EVO and other locales to play Marvel vs. Capcom 2. But before all that, in the early stages of learning the game, the feeling of not necessarily knowing what I was doing was one of my fondest experiences.</p>
<p><img alt="image" height="281px;" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Aym8QVKVUNPE2YR8S9jADDJ4_z43hSPJeKGttAs2JT4nB0K7yo_DbhgnZ0Oi_Y-EwPqipJvFF58BkdJuGIYg20-503mI_bGKh-gwJX4HwZiEdG1PxwzJLf1q_Q" width="500px;" /></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-40f69531-22ba-2f05-c625-340b600299e5"><span>In MvC2, I would press random buttons and observe the outcome. After a while, patterns became recognizable, but not entirely understood. This method of input experimentation is what I call <em>controlled chaos</em>, the unintentional improvisation as a means to succeed as well as to learn. Though my inputs were intentional, the results were unintentional and occurred naturally as if improvised. In reality, it was all just a part of my learning process.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Despite feeling random, I take credit in knowing I am solely responsible for each resulting discovery. So in Aces Wild and MvC2, when I pull off something freakin&rsquo; amazing, there&rsquo;s an intrinsic reward of &ldquo;I was responsible for that&rdquo;, rather than an extrinsic reward of &ldquo;The game gave me this.&rdquo;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>In contrast to a game where the mechanics are revealed to the player as they progress, in Aces Wild, all the mechanics are available to the player and it is up to the player to discover his ability to perform.</span></p>
<p><strong>Randomness as a means of self discovery</strong></p>
<p>Take for example the artwork of Jackson Pollock, who became famous for his drip style paintings. Outwardly, these paintings look purely random, but pure randomness would imply that there was no intent behind his actions at all and I would argue there is a method to his madness. As he dripped paint on the floor Pollock began the exploration and discovery of himself, learning of his method and changing based on his observations.</p>

<p>And so, when I play Aces Wild, I remembered how I learned to play Marvel vs. Capcom 2 by observing the results of random input, and it made me wonder what other games could convey this emotion.</p>
<p>Random goes in, something comes out, I know I have influence on it, but I never can fully understand it.</p>

<p><span>What other games has <em>controlled chaos</em> helped you to discover your personal abilities?</span></p>
