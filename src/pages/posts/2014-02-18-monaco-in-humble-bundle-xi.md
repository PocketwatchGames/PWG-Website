<p><b></b></p><!-- more --><p><b>About Humble Bundles</b></p>
<p>OK, let's say you've been living under a rock for the past 4 years. &nbsp;If so, you missed out on one of the weirdest trends in games: the Humble Bundle.</p>
<p>Humble Bundles are "Pay What You Want" sales of a bundle of games. &nbsp;That means you can pay as low as 1 cent, and as high as you want, for 5 or so games. &nbsp;Many people do pay 1 cent, but many people pay in the hundreds of dollars, simply as a way to say thank you to the creators of the games in the bundles. &nbsp;Customers can also choose to give a percentage (or all) of the money to charities like the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a>.</p>
<p>Both Monaco and Antichamber are "Beat the Average" games, meaning that you have to pay more than the average price that people choose to pay in order to get them... usually between 4 and 8 dollars.</p>
<p><b>Bold Predictions</b></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Humble_Bundles">Here's a list</a> of the previous bundles. &nbsp;Pay attention to the Humbe Indie Bundles in particular. &nbsp;If I'm guessing, HIB11 will perform similarly to HIB8, the one that featured these games:</p>
<ul><li>Hotline Miami</li>
<li>Dear Esther</li>
<li>Thomas Was Alone</li>
<li>Awesomenauts</li>
<li>Little Inferno</li>
<li>Capsized</li>
<li>Proteus</li>
</ul><p>That bundle grossed $2.63 million with&nbsp;448,750 customers, paying an average price of&nbsp;$5.86.</p>
<p>If you're curious about how we're paid: Despite the fact that HB allows customers to split their payment amongst Humble Bundle, the game creators, and the charities, the money usually ends up matching the default slider amounts. &nbsp;So with 15% going to HB, 20% to charity, and 65% to developers, that means that HIB8 made about $1.7M for the devs. &nbsp;There are additional games that are added into the mix, partway through the campaign, but my guess is that they only account for about 1 additional game worth of revenue. &nbsp;So split that $1.7M eight ways and you end up with about $214,000 per developer.</p>
<p>Not bad for a couple week's work!</p>
