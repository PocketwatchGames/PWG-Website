title: "YouTube blocked a Monaco video because of a freesound.org file"
---

<p>Recently, a Let's Player named <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ioisin1001/videos" title="ioisin1001">ioisin1001</a>&nbsp;on YouTube contacted us saying that YouTube had blocked his video because of copyright Content ID. The video in question is here:</p>

<!-- more --><p>Monaco has a lot of ambient sound effects, most of which were obtained from the public domain library of sound effects </p><p><a href="www.freesound.org" title="Freesound.org">Freesound.org</a></p><p>. In the level editor, I can place these sound effects to create atmosphere for the level. In this level, you rob the Prince of Monaco's Royal Palace. &nbsp;
</p><p>Inside this palace is a Cathedral, where we play an ambient church sound. Past the heavy heartbeat of the dead Hacker is a church choir played very lightly.</p>
<p>This is the sound effect here:</p>

<p>As it turns out, a death metal band used the same sample as the intro to their song, and then claimed copyright to their song, which contained the public domain sample.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Is this an example of a flawed system?</p>
