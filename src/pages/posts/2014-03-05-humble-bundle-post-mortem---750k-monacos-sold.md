title: "Humble Bundle Post Mortem - 750K Monacos sold!"
---

<p>Monaco just finished up its two week run in Humble Indie Bundle 11. &nbsp;So, how'd we do?</p>
<p><strong>Total payments:&nbsp;</strong><span>$2,323,681</span></p>
<ul><li><span>Ranked 6th among 11 Humble Indie Bundles</span></li>
<li><span>Highest Gross: HIB 5&nbsp;($5.10+ M)</span></li>
</ul><p><strong>Number of purchases:&nbsp;</strong><span>493,816</span></p>
<ul><li><span>Ranked 3rd&nbsp;among 11 Humble Indie Bundles</span></li>
<li><span>Most units sold: HIB 9 (715,012 units)</span></li>
</ul><p><span>We sold a ton of units, but with a fairly low average price ($4.71). One can probably assign partial blame to&nbsp;the Beat the Average games,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://monacoismine.com/">Monaco</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/#game-info-antichamber_storefront">Antichamber</a><span>. &nbsp;T</span>he bundle may have ended up with a higher average price (and thus a much higher gross) had Monaco been swapped with <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/#game-info-guacamelee">Guacamelee</a> or <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/#game-info-dust_anelysiantail">Dust: An Elysian Tale</a>. &nbsp;Even so, we performed quite well, and a lot of people are playing our games now!</p>
<p><strong>How much did Monaco make?</strong></p>
<p>Monaco was a Beat the Average game, which means that not all HIB bundle sales resulted in a Monaco sale. &nbsp;Of the 493,000 bundles sold, 370,034&nbsp;of them included Monaco. &nbsp;Of those,&nbsp;270,677 have activated their Steam keys. &nbsp;Interestingly, this means three quarters of the Humble customers beat the average. &nbsp;(Remember that the average starts low and climbs as people beat the average)</p>
<p><em>This means that Monaco has now sold over 750,000 copies!</em></p>
<p><span>Distribution of revenue typically ends up being the default distribution of&nbsp;</span>65% developers, 20% charity, 15% humble tip.</p>
<p>With 6 developers, plus the mid-week additions of Fez, Starseed Pilgrim, and BeatBuddy, that's around 8% per developer.</p>
<p>Monaco grossed approximately $215,000 over the course of the Humble Bundle. &nbsp;Of course we'll know more when we get the actual sales report. &nbsp;In any case, that's a nice hefty sum!</p>

<p>This chart shows gross revenue of sale on Steam (not Humble Bundle) over the last 31 days. &nbsp;The Humble Bundle started on the 18th. &nbsp;Despite the huge number of units that we sold in the Humble Bundle, it doesn't appear that our presence in the HIB affected our day-to-day Steam revenue.</p>
<p>Why is this? &nbsp;My guess is that customers tend to be loyal to sales channels. &nbsp;Customers that buy from Humble Bundle tend to only buy indie games from there, and customers that buy full priced games on Steam probably don't know about -- or don't care about -- Humble Bundle.</p>
<p>What do you think? &nbsp;Any theories as to why Steam sales don't appear to be affected by an active Pay What You Want bundle?</p>
