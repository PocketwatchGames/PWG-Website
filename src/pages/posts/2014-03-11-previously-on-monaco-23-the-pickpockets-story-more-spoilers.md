<p><span>|Inspector Voltaire|&nbsp;</span>Your friend already told me everything.</p>
<p><span>|Inspector Voltaire|&nbsp;</span>The Prison Break, the Hijack, the Mole, everything.</p>
<p><span>|Pickpocket|&nbsp;</span>My friend has a... complicated... relationship with the truth.</p>
<p><span>|Inspector Voltaire|&nbsp;</span>Are you trying to tell me that you didn't escape from prison?</p>
<p><span>|Inspector Voltaire|&nbsp;</span>You didn't rob the palace, the museum, the casino?</p>
<p><span>|Inspector Voltaire|&nbsp;</span>And you didn't kill a man in a nightclub?</p>
<p><span>|Pickpocket|&nbsp;</span>Not so fast, Clouseau.</p>
<p><span>|Pickpocket|&nbsp;</span>Start at the beginning. At the hijack.</p>
<p><span>|Pickpocket|&nbsp;</span>If you'll check your records...</p>
<p><span>|Pickpocket|&nbsp;</span>...you'll notice that only 3 prisoners were listed as missing the night of the prison break...</p>
<p><span>|Pickpocket|&nbsp;</span>... And The Mole wasn't the only prisoner that went missing at the hijack.</p>
<p><span>|Inspector Voltaire|&nbsp;</span>But we rounded up all the other prisoners from the transport!</p>
<p><span>|Pickpocket|&nbsp;</span>Are you sure about that?</p>
<p><span>|Pickpocket|&nbsp;</span>We're in Monaco...</p>
<p><span>|Pickpocket|&nbsp;</span>Do you really think you can tell the difference...</p>
<p><span>|Pickpocket|&nbsp;</span>Between the liars, the gamblers, and the thieves?</p>
<p><span>|OBJECTIVE|&nbsp;</span>The Pickpocket's recollection of the accident scene is quite a bit more hectic. Prepare for a challenge. READY?</p>
