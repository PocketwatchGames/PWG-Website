<p><span>Hi folks! </span><strong>Andy Nguyen</strong><span> here a.k.a. </span><strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/pixelatedpost" target="_blank">@pixelatedpost</a></strong></p>
<p><span>I recently got invited to play the </span><span><a href="http://www.heroesofthestorm.com/en-us" target="_blank">Heroes of the Storm</a>&nbsp;</span><span>Technical Alpha. The Alpha is invite-only for friends and family of employees at Blizzard. As far as I know, this was the first invite wave, so I expect the sample size to be very small.</span></p>
<p><span>After my first game, I walked away with 2 major impressions:</span></p>
<p><span>1. I absolutely </span><span><strong>LOVE</strong></span><span> this game. This is my fondest MOBA experience, and I have not enjoyed playing other MOBAs</span></p>
<p><span>2. I may never want to play this game ever again.</span></p>
<p><span>Let's talk about what happened.</span><!-- more --></p>
<p><strong>Game Design: Depth vs. Complexity</strong></p>
<p><span>A players lasting impression on a game can often times be determined by their very initial experience. Video games can be long, expensive, and with hundreds of unplayed games in the backlog, people can be quick to judge.</span></p>
<p><span>This creates a problem for MOBAs and it is something we hope to address in [ARMADA]. When I hop into a MOBA, I see 70+ unique characters, hundreds of items, and necessary strategies that a new player can't even begin to understand yet.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, here are all the items in League of Legends. How does this feel to someone who's never played the game before?</span><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="596" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kipf02w_x4pG79Cs3FB6tOy1_6lx3caXK2HZ774xPe63g2XXn9X09dt9DSaDmpgZKw42lTfUh8ueO58656KEiVCVvcYjosGdsHX5hJLaRh_U2leyINyE7QdwyZj83g"><img alt="image" height="596px;" src="/img/2014-03-26-nguyen-plays-heroes-of-the-storm-loved-it-but-may-never-want-to-play-it-again\5f8371e0b4267f3828798a523a5dc5ac42ed265d40dc28582489af4dbef9131a.png" width="500px;" data-orig-height="596" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kipf02w_x4pG79Cs3FB6tOy1_6lx3caXK2HZ774xPe63g2XXn9X09dt9DSaDmpgZKw42lTfUh8ueO58656KEiVCVvcYjosGdsHX5hJLaRh_U2leyINyE7QdwyZj83g"></figure><span>In order to address depth vs. complexity, Blizzard opted to remove gold drops as a secondary currency, resulting in the absence of all these items. With constant frenetic combat, the last thing I want to do is browse a store or manage an inventory.&nbsp;I'm sure that a store would create more in-game strategies, but it immediately takes you away from the task at hand, which is combat.</span></p>
<p>Because Blizzard removed the extraneous complexity,&nbsp;I can immediately formulate strategies based on what I know about the game and spend less time simply learning how to play the game. In this case, complexity was removed, but depth is still retained.</p>
<p><strong>So what went wrong?</strong></p>
<p><span>During my first online game, we were losing (it happens) and one of the teammates started berating the team.</span></p>
<p><span>He looked for people to blame, and Abathur immediately came under accusation. Funny thing is, Abathur is a character who works remotely. He roots into the ground and does not move. As a result, he spawns creep where he roots and can buff allies remotely to aid them in combat.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried sitting quiet, but eventually I spoke up and told him to watch this video.</span></p>
<div class="vid-box"><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ugXC7g3p0JU?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></div>
<p>League of Legends has been trying to combat poor sportsmanship since the beginning. They always supplement their points with <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/191262/Video_Fixing_toxic_online_behavior_in_League_of_Legends.php" target="_blank">statistics</a>, like how bad behavior statistically results in fewer wins and fewer comebacks. I felt like this perspective could shift this player's bad behavior.</p>
<p><span>He responded by calling me a </span>fag<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>At first I thought, this is supposed to be an exclusive invite-only alpha for friends and family of the people who worked on the game, so surely there is </span><em>some</em><span> level of maturity and responsibility. The game isn't available to the public where </span><span><em>anyone</em> </span><span>can join. And yet, my </span><strong>FIRST GAME</strong><span> had this level of </span>toxicity<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>My experience immediately went from "Best MOBA game ever" to "I don't really wanna play this game anymore".</span></p>
<p><span>Video games and the people who play them are a community I absolutely hold dear to myself. I identify myself as a passionate gamer and when I see behavior like this, it makes me lose faith in who I am, the gamers I love, and the gamers I fight for as a developer.</span></p>
<p><strong>Our community going forward</strong></p>
<p><span>We don't take this behavior lightly. It's impossible to monitor all that happens in a game, and I'm sure there were many instances of rage in Monaco. One of the ways Monaco helps to combat rage is that it makes failure fun and somewhat expected. There is fun in the mayhem of getting caught and trying to get away.</span></p>
<p><span>We also limit how much an individual's failure affects the rest of the team. There are no shared lives and ammo is something players keep for themselves. We even made the Redhead resurrect players faster in case a team has trouble staying alive.</span></p>
<p><span>So what can we do about [ARMADA]? We could take the Journey route and disable communication or we could do what Hearthstone did and only enable emotes like "I LOVE YOU" and "YOU'RE THE BEST!".</span></p>
<p><span>Both of those seem like solutions to symptoms rather than preventing the problem in the first place. Losing after playing an hour long match sure feels a lot like wasted time, so could shorter rounds relieve some rage?</span></p>
<p><span>In either case, we definitely acknowledge that online behavior can be a problem, so here's to hoping [ARMADA] can be a fun experience for everyone, win or lose.</span></p>
