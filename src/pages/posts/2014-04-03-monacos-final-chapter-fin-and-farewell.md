title: "Monaco's Final Chapter: Fin. and farewell!"
---

<p>And thus closes a chapter...</p>
<p>Today, on April 3rd, 2014, we're turning the last page of Monaco by releasing a <strong>free update</strong> containing the 4th and final campaign of the game. &nbsp;This campaign is brutally difficult (all eight levels are as hard as <em>Identity</em>) and it concludes the story of the Gentleman and his nefarious crew. &nbsp;It's called <em>Monaco: Fin</em>.</p>

<p>I designed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/monaco/the-original-monaco-game-design-from-2003/496033541995">Monaco on paper</a> in 2003 when I was still an employee of a much bigger (now defunct) game developer. &nbsp;Development started in October of 2009. &nbsp;Andy Nguyen joined the team in May 2011. &nbsp;The game launched in April 2013. &nbsp;One year later, nearly a million copies of the game sold, and it's time to move on.</p>
<p>It's time to bring something new into the world. &nbsp;It's time to start over. &nbsp;It's time for us to earn your attention again.</p>

<p><strong><span>The Story So Far</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It's hard to distill the&nbsp;</span>experience<span>&nbsp;of the past few years down to a blog post. &nbsp;EVERYTHING has changed. &nbsp;My design philosophy, our lives, Pocketwatch, indie games as a movement, the internet as a whole. &nbsp;So please forgive me if I ramble a bit.</span></p>
<p><span><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="706" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="/assets/blog/img/2014-04-03-monacos-final-chapter-fin-and-farewell\a5cd76aa6cc4a59e60d9eea872f2feb5e6dbe2d48dca75b249c61770a0f14ad3.png"><img alt="image" src="/assets/blog/img/2014-04-03-monacos-final-chapter-fin-and-farewell\6f9038401c43ed42fee082c9fb87850ec1c20e673c4cd145b10c9f4249a7b77c.png" data-orig-height="706" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="/assets/blog/img/2014-04-03-monacos-final-chapter-fin-and-farewell\a5cd76aa6cc4a59e60d9eea872f2feb5e6dbe2d48dca75b249c61770a0f14ad3.png"></figure></span></p>
<p><span>For both Andy Nguyen and I, Monaco has been the culmination of lifelong dreams. &nbsp;Nguyen loves games more than anything else in the world. &nbsp;Seriously. &nbsp;He is the type of guy who escaped to games when he was a kid, but was always told that games were a dead-end hobby. &nbsp;When he originally contacted me about helping out (in any capacity) on Monaco, he had no production skills and no development experience. &nbsp;He had passion.</span></p>
<p><span>And with that passion, he immediately dove into QA: web-camming himself playing the game for hours on end, keeping a spreadsheet of the bugs he discovered and his thoughts and suggestions on game design. &nbsp;It wasn't long before he was designing levels. &nbsp;And organizing our PAX presence. &nbsp;And managing our community. &nbsp;And contributing to the core design. &nbsp;And rethinking our development practices. &nbsp;And networking within the community. &nbsp;Monaco wouldn't have online multiplayer without Nguyen. It wouldn't have 4 stellar campaigns. &nbsp;It would have been a small game... a curious little thing rather than a big, deep world of design and fiction to get lost in.</span></p>
<p><span>Nguyen designed all of the levels currently in the game, and he's the one that's been keeping Monaco's development alive for the past year.</span></p>

<p><span>For me (Andy Schatz), the journey, and the rewards, have been equally staggering.</span></p>

<p>Memories of Monaco's <a href="http://www.igf.com/2010finalistswinners.html">surprise win</a> in the 2010 IGF will live with me always. &nbsp;I was married just a few months after that. &nbsp;I'll never forget <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/monaco/whats-up-with-the-xbox-version/10152207887761996">the circuitous route</a> that Monaco took to finally make it on XBLA, and the disastrous two week delay when launch day finally came around. &nbsp;Two weeks after launch, stress caused my immune system to shut down and I got shingles. &nbsp;SHINGLES. &nbsp;That's a disease that only eighty-year-olds get. &nbsp;That's a disease that you get when your immune system mic-drops and exits stage left.</p>
<p><span>I've spent nearly a decade running Pocketwatch... trying to -- and&nbsp;</span>occasionally<span>&nbsp;succeeding at -- <a href="http://pocketwatchgames.com/games.html#africa">making interesting, fun games</a>. &nbsp;Trying to turn a passion&nbsp;for subject matters, be they ecosystems or heist movies, into simple games driven by complex systems. &nbsp;I've spent years trying to understand this crazy business of independent game development as it twists and turns and reinvents itself constantly. &nbsp;It has always been worth it. &nbsp;And FINALLY, I'm done chasing the brass ring.</span></p>
<p><span>The money I've made from Monaco is kinda gross, when taken in one big chunk. &nbsp;But it's really only about what I would have made had I been working for a salary all that time. &nbsp;I've been living pretty frugally...and I'm glad. &nbsp;It took a decade for the dedication to pay off.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>So... back to Monaco</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Since launch we've added (for FREE)</span></p>
<ul><li><span>Steam Workshop support</span></li>
<li><span>Level Editor</span></li>
<li><span>Mac Support</span></li>
<li><span>Linux support</span></li>
<li><span>Rocket Launcher</span></li>
<li><span>Major changes to the Hacker class</span></li>
<li><span>New class: The Blonde</span></li>
<li><span>Zombie mode (why not?)</span></li>
<li><span>Enhanced edition, based on your feedback</span></li>
<li><span>New Campaign: </span><em>Monaco: Origins</em></li>
<li><span>Bonus PVP missions, cuz they were super fun</span></li>
<li><span>And now the final curtain call, <em>Monaco: Fin</em>.</span></li>
</ul><p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="375" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="/assets/blog/img/2014-04-03-monacos-final-chapter-fin-and-farewell\2435b3c77876105b8a45cd7a23b742cce65ae8d656c47dfabee9a48d2e54d717.jpg"><img alt="image" src="/assets/blog/img/2014-04-03-monacos-final-chapter-fin-and-farewell\ef8f563a35c3637d549a127651c20250a77ebeaccaad4e8350b2b7edc621cd2b.jpg" data-orig-height="375" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="/assets/blog/img/2014-04-03-monacos-final-chapter-fin-and-farewell\2435b3c77876105b8a45cd7a23b742cce65ae8d656c47dfabee9a48d2e54d717.jpg"></figure></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Our development on Monaco is coming to an end now, but who knows if we will revisit it sometime in the future. &nbsp;Maybe a decade from now we'll reinvent the little known cult-classic that was once called "one of the best co-op games of all time".</span></p>
<p><span>We do hope you enjoy this last glimpse into the criminal capers of the Smith, the Lookout, the Pickpocket, the Cleaner, the Mole, the Gent, the Redhead, and the Hacker. &nbsp;We'll miss them as much as you.</span></p>
<p><span>And we hope you'll stick around so that we can entertain you with new adventures, challenges, and memories in the next chapter of Pocketwatch Games.</span></p>
<p><span>Au revoir, mes amis. &nbsp;We hope you are still here when morning comes.</span></p>
