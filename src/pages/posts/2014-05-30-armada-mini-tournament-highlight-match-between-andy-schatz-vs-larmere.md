title: "[ARMADA] Mini-tournament, highlight match between Andy Schatz vs Larmere"
---

<p>We did a stream recently on our Twitch channel at <a href="www.twitch.tv/PWGtwitch">www.twitch.tv/PWGtwitch</a> which resulted in an amazing match between <a href="www.twitter.com/andyschatz">Andy Schatz</a> and community member Laremere.</p>
<p>The stream began as a demonstration match between two alpha testers, but quickly turned into a tournament when Laremere jumped into chat and challenged Andy Schatz to a fight. &nbsp;The winner of that battle would then face off with the previous champion to see who would reign supreme.</p>
<p>The match turned out to be an intense and unpredictable one with commentary provided by <a href="www.twitter.com/pixelatedpost">Andy Nguyen</a>. &nbsp;I can't begin to describe how exciting it is that our pre-alpha version of [ARMADA] is already a fun and competitive experience.</p>
<p>All the art, units, structures, and design are works in progress, so nothing is final. &nbsp;We still have a long ways to go, and we hope to talk about our future art direction soon.</p>
<p>Check out the whole highlighted series <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/pwgtwitch/b/532762131">here</a>, and look forward to future competitive matches of [ARMADA] on our <a href="www.twitch.tv/PWGtwitch">Twitch channel</a>.</p>
