title: "Two games or one? Tightening the focus on armies, not heroes"
---

<p>[ARMADA] development progress has been really satisfying so far. &nbsp;We are implementing designs and features at such a high velocity that we can't help but be excited to see what's next. &nbsp;Morale is through the roof.</p>

<p>That's not to say that the core design is fully implemented. &nbsp;There was a major feature that we had kept on the back burner because we couldn't figure out the specifics of the mechanical design.</p>
<p><span>That feature is Hero Abilities.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitch.tv/pwgtwitch/b/533752301">(I did an hour long explanation of the problem, and our ORIGINAL proposed solution, on twitch)</a></p>

<p>As a reminder, [ARMADA] is an RTS that you can comfortably play on a controller. &nbsp;That means no unit selection, no orders, no "simulated mouse cursor". &nbsp;Armies in [ARMADA] are autonomous and controlled indirectly by a player-controlled hero.</p>
<p><span>From the beginning, we always envisioned the hero not just as an army-control device, but also as a unit himself, generally playing support roles like healers and spellcasters in Starcraft. &nbsp;We wanted to avoid the feeling that the player hero was just a shitty mouse cursor.</span></p>
<p><span>If we had already solved the basic "RTS on a gamepad" problem, Hero Abilities were going to be the final piece in the game design puzzle that made [ARMADA] even MORE fun to play, MORE accessible than a game like Starcraft.</span></p>
<p><span>Let the hero shoot! &nbsp;Let them jump! &nbsp;Let them stealth! &nbsp;Maybe go fishing! &nbsp;How about yoga? &nbsp;It'll be awesome!</span></p>
<p><span>When we finally tried to implement our Hero Ability design, we kept going around in circles. &nbsp;Ultimately we decided we were working too much. &nbsp;Time to take a day off to clear our game-design muddled heads. &nbsp;It was worth it.</span></p>
<p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="300" data-orig-width="400" data-orig-src="/img/2014-06-05-two-games-or-one-tightening-the-focus-on-armies-not-heroes\9e253fc2f93130e9f8df5d343165e8a8f55669c4ecf97f44ce431563e53e0794.png"><img alt="image" src="/img/2014-06-05-two-games-or-one-tightening-the-focus-on-armies-not-heroes\5bd83f358f9df1d61e2a8714a255520b4ccc50fc18e1703dcbad15b1a6aea8a4.png" data-orig-height="300" data-orig-width="400" data-orig-src="/img/2014-06-05-two-games-or-one-tightening-the-focus-on-armies-not-heroes\9e253fc2f93130e9f8df5d343165e8a8f55669c4ecf97f44ce431563e53e0794.png"></figure></p>
<p>The extra time helped us think about the game we want to make. &nbsp;Hero abilities made the game FEEL more like a MOBA than an RTS. &nbsp;But we're not making a MOBA. &nbsp;We're not making a dungeon crawler or a dual stick shooter. &nbsp;We're making an RTS.</p>
<p><span>The last thing we want is to make a hybrid, a mash-up, of two genres. &nbsp;Most of the time hybrid games just end up being mediocre at two things.</span></p>
<p><span>So let's make an RTS, just an RTS, and let's make it great!</span></p>
<p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="200" data-orig-width="400" data-orig-src="/img/2014-06-05-two-games-or-one-tightening-the-focus-on-armies-not-heroes\169d03444cf590f68489d05ece856923751e64aa10fcbd32c90881ee5bf3eead.png"><img alt="image" src="/img/2014-06-05-two-games-or-one-tightening-the-focus-on-armies-not-heroes\d238a6f4abcdd7b7034ec27ef51a4f0467d2e0a5d2d0e8473e276aaf812c1d4e.png" data-orig-height="200" data-orig-width="400" data-orig-src="/img/2014-06-05-two-games-or-one-tightening-the-focus-on-armies-not-heroes\169d03444cf590f68489d05ece856923751e64aa10fcbd32c90881ee5bf3eead.png"></figure></p>
<p>So what if there was no hero? &nbsp;Or at least, what if the "hero" unit was not of a different class than the other units on the field? &nbsp;What if the player could promote any unit in the field to be the commander?</p>
<p>HMMMMMM......</p>
<p>This solves a number of design problems for us:</p>
<p><span>1) Hero Abilities are baked in to Commander selection</span></p>
<p>Rather than adding upgradable Hero Abilities (as we had planned), the player can get the same variety of experience simply by assuming control over his various different unit classes. &nbsp;Want to control a flying hero? Assume control over a flying creature. &nbsp;Want to sneak into the enemy base? &nbsp;Assume control over a stealth unit.</p>
<p><span>2) Split forces and unit control</span></p>
<p>We've struggled with how to allow the player to control only a small subset of their forces so they could, for instance, lead just your stealthed units into the enemy base while leaving your main force at home. &nbsp;Now that you have control over a standard class of unit, we can accomplish single-class unit control with one additional button. &nbsp;This also allows us to have split-army attacks.</p>
<p><span>3) FEELS more like an RTS</span></p>
<p>RTS games are about armies, not heroes. &nbsp;Making the player hero simply be another unit on the field allows us to put the thematic focus on the group rather than the individual. &nbsp;L<span>arge scale battles can be the forefront of the strategic experience.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>We don't know how far this rabbit hole will lead, but it's a really interesting angle to explore for our game. &nbsp;Look forward to our demonstration matches on at </span><a href="www.twitch.tv/PWGtwitch">www.twitch.tv/PWGtwitch</a><span> to see how it turns out!</span></p>
