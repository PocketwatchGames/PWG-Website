<p><strong>Fall, 56th day</strong></p>
<p><span>Quartermaster reports the following stores missing:</span></p>
<ul><li><span>12 Cans figs</span></li>
<li><span>3 Cans pig hearts</span></li>
<li><span>Sack of feathers</span></li>
<li><span>2 Bundles kindling</span></li>
<li><span>1 Blanket</span></li>
</ul><p><span>Spirits in the 12th Rattus are low. &nbsp;Bellafide&rsquo;s maxim may soon be put to the test. &nbsp;Generals continue to report that the 9th Corvidae has been dispatched, but my rats are starting to lose faith.</span></p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p><strong>Fall, 61st day</strong></p>
<p>Scouts returned from the Warrens. &nbsp;Old Guard troops were seen marching North, towards the enemy.</p>
<p><span>Today was a good day, and we dipped deeper into our dwindling rations over an unruly fire.</span></p>
<p><span>Katrina had too much cider, she&rsquo;ll be whipped when she&rsquo;s sober enough to care. &nbsp;The Animal&rsquo;s Army doesn&rsquo;t easily conform to military discipline. &nbsp;We are angels, survivors: We are bred to breed, built to live, even if the process can be messy. &nbsp;Katrina will survive too.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Fall, 81st day</strong></p>
<p>Dispatch reports that the 9th Corvidae intercepted a pork delivery headed to the northern front. &nbsp;&ldquo;A Win for the Great Animal&rsquo;s Army&rdquo; they called it. Meanwhile, the 12th Rattus chews on fig root. &nbsp;I doubt we&rsquo;ll see any of that pork, or the crows for that matter. &nbsp;Too fat to fly, I suspect.</p>
<p><span>Quartermaster reports that we&rsquo;ve one week of rations left.</span></p>
<p><span>Katrina is recovering. &nbsp;Tomorrow we march.</span></p>

<p><strong>Fall, 89th day</strong></p>
<p>We took a westerly route around the Warrens, along the ridge abutting the Grey Sea. &nbsp;We expect to see Bellafide&rsquo;s troops tonight. &nbsp;They fly their colors brightly. &nbsp;They aren&rsquo;t likely to smell our approach, what with the wind whipping up from the valley.</p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;ve been told they are turtled in a valley beyond this one. &nbsp;If our intelligence is correct, the members of PMC Lacertilia won&rsquo;t survive till dawn. &nbsp;My rats are hungry.</span></p>

<p><strong>Fall, 90th day</strong></p>
<p>A bloody victory, but the spoils were ruined. &nbsp;The lizards were accompanied by an attachment of skunks.</p>
<p><span>The 12th Rattus did what we do best. &nbsp;We scrabbled down the hill, careful not to kick up the loose shale. &nbsp;We had only enough cloaks for half the troops, the other half closed their eyes to prevent glare from the moonlight giving away our position. &nbsp;The lizards were in a metabolic stupor on account of the morose Northern daylight, and so nine lizards fell to the knife before any woke to sound the alarm.</span></p>
<p><span>But the alarm did sound, and minutes later we heard the rattle of cannisters. &nbsp;The tell-tale black and white fled towards the Warrens, leaving their reptilian allies to choke. &nbsp;I lost four rats to the &lsquo;mustard&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p><span>Worse, the meat is spoiled. &nbsp;Not a single corpse was untouched by those damned skunks. &nbsp;Decisions will have to be made.</span></p>

<p><strong>Winter, 2nd day</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Culling&rdquo; was barbaric, the church famously corrupt. &nbsp;Not once did the Pontiffs select one of their own to be sent to the &lsquo;Shoppes. &nbsp;And so when Bellafide rose up against the Pontiffs, we all followed. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then the clergy went into hiding and Bellafide rose to power on the slogan &ldquo;Have Faith in Freedom&rdquo;. &nbsp;But when we starved, did she replace The Culling? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;She left us to fend for ourselves, and so the aristocracy became fat on the meat of my brothers. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pigs will eat pigs, and rats will eat their own,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;What she really meant was that the strong will eat the weak, and the rich will eat the poor.</span></p>
<p><span>Not us. &nbsp;That is not the way of the Animal&rsquo;s Army.</span></p>
<p><span>We are all hungry. &nbsp;Tonight we vote.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Winter, 3rd day</strong></p>
<p>Quartermaster reports that we have food to last 3 weeks: flanks, leg, offal are all in prime condition, back meat was ruined and was discarded. &nbsp;Today we march with full bellies.</p>
<p><span>Katrina will be missed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
