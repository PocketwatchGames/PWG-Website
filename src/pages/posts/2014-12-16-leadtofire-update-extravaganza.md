<p>Hi folks! On the back of an extremely <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/pocketwatch/c/5690738">successful dev stream</a>, we thought we'd post a few updates about LEADtoFIRE for those of you who can't tune in to our weekly broadcast (<a href="http://www.twitch.tv/Pocketwatch">http://www.twitch.tv/Pocketwatch</a> every Thursday at 2pm PST/5pm EST, duh). We've made a lot of progress on the game since our last post so let's get right in to it!</p>
<p><b>ART UPDATES!</b><br><a href="http://chichapie.deviantart.com/">Jerome Jacinto</a> has been cranking through some great unit designs, putting together in-game assets for our four flag-bearers, pictured below along the top row, as well as a few of the soldiers that you can recruit in to your army of animal revolutionaries. Of course, the assets are still a work in progress and subject to change, but this should give you an idea of the art style and character fidelity we're going for!</p>

<p><b>GAMEPLAY UPDATES!</b></p>
<p><i><b>Bolster your troops!<br></b></i>During alpha testing we found that players who were ahead in the early game tended to stay ahead and win the match. We wanted to create a comeback mechanic for players that were beaten in an early to mid-game skirmish so that they could get back in to the fight and have a chance of winning the match. We introduced the Warcry mechanic to our alpha testers and it was an immediate favorite. For every unit and structure you lose, your Warcry meter increases. When it fills up completely, you get a one-shot ability that can drastically alter the course of the game, from buffing your army's damage to giving them super-speed, allowing you to rush an opponent or beat a hasty retreat to fight another day.</p>
<p></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="320" data-orig-width="480" data-orig-src="/assets/blog/img/2014-12-16-leadtofire-update-extravaganza\5ea44a7a6ce7760dcdfa4d5236b976ab2fe2ce501881ba48e400210f4897a9b6.png"><img src="/assets/blog/img/2014-12-16-leadtofire-update-extravaganza\ba8dca2a3d245aaee1570604a3bdcad758b21efd790c5e7b650fecffecfa412d.png" alt="image" data-orig-height="320" data-orig-width="480" data-orig-src="/assets/blog/img/2014-12-16-leadtofire-update-extravaganza\5ea44a7a6ce7760dcdfa4d5236b976ab2fe2ce501881ba48e400210f4897a9b6.png"></figure><p></p>

<p>Warcries ended up accomplishing a few design goals:</p>
<ol><li>Empower the player to directly influence the battlefield</li>
<li>Give the player more meaningful moment to moment choices</li>
<li>Fulfill the fantasy that the player is a pivotal character in the outcome of this war</li>
<li>Allow players to come back from any given fight</li>
<li>Create more hidden information, allowing the strategy to be less deterministic</li>
</ol><p><b><i>Claim your territory!</i></b><br>We also found that building forward bases and rushing were popular strategies employed by almost all of the high level players. While we love the idea of proxying for quick reinforcements or brutal rushes, we don't want that to be the only viable strategy in the game. To curb the rush-only meta, we decided to implement a territory-based system. Now, players own territory, starting with all tiles in an 8-tile radius from your HQ. You cannot build outside of your territory, so to proxy your opponent or build massive armies, you have to gain more territory by building more HQs, or by choosing the Outpost structure as part of your army composition.</p>
<p>With the Outpost structure, you can claim territory anywhere on the map at a low cost. In addition, some structures now have the Proxy tag, which allows them to be built outside of your territory without the need for an HQ or Outpost. These changes let you compose armies that specialize in sneaky strategies, all-out rushes, or quick reinforcement.</p>
