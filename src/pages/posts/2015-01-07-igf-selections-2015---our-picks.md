title: "IGF Selections 2015 - Our Picks"
---

<p>The <a href="http://igf.com/2015/01/2015_independent_games_festiva_1.html">IGF 2015 nominations</a> are out and a bunch of our favorites games of the year are in there. &nbsp;Last month, the judging process had ended and these were our favorite games from the bunch.</p>
<p><b>Nguyen's Picks</b></p>
<p><a href="http://jimmylands.com/experiments/kissing/" title="Realistic Kissing Simulator">Realistic Kissing Simulator</a></p>
<p>Not gonna lie, this game is freakin' hilarious. There's something to be said about a game that generates a unique experience between you and someone else.. sorta like kissing? &nbsp;It's not really coop, it's definitely not PvP, but it's something. &nbsp;There's even a really nice touch of requiring consent before starting the game. &nbsp;If it's your first time, don't worry, just don't force it and do what's natural. &nbsp;It's as realistic a kissing simulator as it can get, all the funsies without the cooties.</p>

<p>It's out, it's free, and it only takes 5 minutes, no reason not to give it a try. &nbsp;Just make sure you have a realistic kissing partner.</p>
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/282070/" title="This War of Mine">This War of Mine</a></p>
<p>I did something awful, then I felt terrible.</p>
<p>I didn't pick the "evil" dialogue branch and realistically what I had done wasn't anywhere near as awful as the things you can do in GTA V, but I still felt awful. &nbsp;What makes This War of Mine different is how the game doesn't place you in a position of power. &nbsp;Seldom do games explore themes of conscience, morality, and human frailty on this level. &nbsp;If you hurt someone, you're hurting a human being, not mindless cannon fodder. &nbsp;Because of this, being bad suddenly isn't as bad ass.</p>

<p><b>Schatz's Picks</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.choicechamber.com/" title="Choice Chamber">Choice Chamber</a></p>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sEwvMxBIOMg" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>Choice Chamber is performance art.&nbsp;It's an improv comedy show with a rowdy drunk audience. The core platforming mechanics are sub-sub-par, but the social interaction that it encourages is something I haven't experienced in a game before. &nbsp;Don't play it for the gameplay, play it for the sadistic abuse of your Twitch viewers. This is the kind of game Nuovo was built for.</p>
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/304410/" title="Hexcells Infinite">Hexcells Infinite</a></p>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0qi3ffxccFc" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>The original Hexcells was IMO overlooked for a design honorable mention in the 2014 IGF, now it's approaching 2015 and a new iteration of the game has got another crack at the IGF. &nbsp;Hexcells is a bit of Picross, a slice of Sudoku, and a bite of Minesweeper, and it manages to explore a wider variety of mechanics than any one of these games.</p>

<p><b>Alex's Pick</b></p>
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/261180/" title="Lethal League">Lethal League</a></p>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/swJJDf2jv88" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>I played Lethal League with Nguyen on our Twitch channel and I was instantly in love with it. I'm a big sucker for personality in games, and this game has a ton of attitude and style. The visuals are juicy and the character design reminds me of Jet Set Radio (which is a _very_ good thing). Matches are fast-paced, the way you interact with your opponent is super unique and cool, and the controls feel great. Favorite moment is pulling off a power shot on a ball that's coming at you unreasonably fast!</p>
<p><a href="http://elseheartbreak.com/" title="else Heart.break()">else Heart.break()</a></p>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aP7KHjeVPCI" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>I'll admit that I haven't had a chance to play else Heart.Break() yet, but after seeing the trailer it jumped to the top of my watch list! The art looks amazing, the setting has got a near-future cyberpunkish vibe, and - after watching some gameplay videos - the idea of the living city where things are happening totally divorced from your story is really interesting to me. Definitely looking forward to getting my hands on this one!</p>
