<p>We are kicking off the New Year introducing our bi-weekly development recaps which will include updates about LEADtoFIRE and Pocketwatch Games.</p>
<p><b>The Alpha expands! (Friend Invites)</b></p>
<p>If you're already in the Alpha, you can invite your friends to come play with you as well. &nbsp;Just jump into the IRC, talk with one of the devs (we are pretty much always in there) and we will set your friends up with alpha access.</p>
<p><b>LEADtoFIRE Gameplay Updates</b></p>
<p><b>Garrisons</b></p>
<p>We've added a garrison mechanic to the game, and now the structures that spawn your units will serve two additional purposes.</p>
<p>1. They can be used to block off the enemy commander and their troops. &nbsp;This allows you to wall off opposing threats or create choke points to defend. &nbsp;Skilled players will manipulate their terrain to&nbsp;maximize&nbsp;their&nbsp;innate advantages.</p>
<p>2. They can be used to hide your troops from the enemy and protect them from enemy fire.</p>
<p><b></b></p><b><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="328" data-orig-width="493" data-orig-src="/img/2015-01-13-bi-weekly-recap-1-friend-invites-giveaways-bunkers-and-more\165b2845a237ce422df60f68a9828d734e9221282be81135264f6bd4be8925f2.png"><img src="/img/2015-01-13-bi-weekly-recap-1-friend-invites-giveaways-bunkers-and-more\37b6c555cd11e6d9ef910b1af92637e950492844768853c3a191e6bd123596d8.png" alt="image" data-orig-height="328" data-orig-width="493" data-orig-src="/img/2015-01-13-bi-weekly-recap-1-friend-invites-giveaways-bunkers-and-more\165b2845a237ce422df60f68a9828d734e9221282be81135264f6bd4be8925f2.png"></figure></b><p></p>
<p>In this picture there are six squirrels. &nbsp;Three of them holding position outside of the northern garrison. &nbsp;The other three squirrels are hiding inside of that garrison. &nbsp;They can fire from within it, but the enemy must destroy the garrison first before attacking the squirrels inside.</p>
<p>Since this is the first implementation of the feature, the garrisoned squirrels are denoted via a Mr. Garrison icon from South Park, but we plan to create better UI for this.</p>
<p>The goal of this design is to increase the defenders advantage to allow for more back and forth gameplay. &nbsp;There are now further strategic choices as to where you place your structure. &nbsp;You can either choose to protect or hide your tech by putting it in the back, or place it on the forefront of the battle so your troops have a safe retreat. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind, lower tier structures have fewer hit points, so whether or not you want to use your expensive tech as a bunker is up to you!</p>
<p><b>Tall Grass</b></p>
<p>We also added tall grass to LEADtoFIRE. &nbsp;Grass allows us to achieve multiple design goals.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Give more environmental based strategies</p>
<p>The world map is an important dimension of strategy. &nbsp;Players will optimize and configure unit compositions and attack timings, but the world map throws a layer of unpredictability into the mix. &nbsp;Some maps favor some strategies over others, and we want to push this even further. &nbsp;We want the ability to read and maximize your terrain to be an important player skill. &nbsp;Monaco did this to great effect and we want to include this layer of design in LEADtoFIRE as well.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Increase hidden information</p>
<p></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="356" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="/img/2015-01-13-bi-weekly-recap-1-friend-invites-giveaways-bunkers-and-more\60f75430c242cb832460196f815d83c601c81a14bb7e31a9fb9a6ab01864ce90.png"><img src="/img/2015-01-13-bi-weekly-recap-1-friend-invites-giveaways-bunkers-and-more\a2730e69cc6b3a9a97631e4270641b87a565b26a4fdd498d3972c049d8305ee4.png" alt="image" data-orig-height="356" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="/img/2015-01-13-bi-weekly-recap-1-friend-invites-giveaways-bunkers-and-more\60f75430c242cb832460196f815d83c601c81a14bb7e31a9fb9a6ab01864ce90.png"></figure><p></p>
<p>In the picture above, the commander is hiding three squirrels, lying in wait so she may catch the enemy off guard and force her opponent to engage in an sub-optimal battle.</p>
<p>Grass essentially lowers your range of vision, requiring you to be near it, or within it to see what is inside.</p>
<p>Hidden information is an important design goal for us because playing with unknowns is how we create moments of tension as well as increase player mental strategy. &nbsp;Texas Hold'em would be significantly less exciting if you could see the opponents hand, and so we are embracing this idea with LEADtoFIRE.</p>
<p>Players will now have to read their opponent and anticipate potential sneak attacks, but it all comes down to whether or not you can read your opponent. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Twitch Highlight of the Week</b></p>
<p>We had an amazing 8-player tournament this last stream, with some of the most exciting matches I've witnessed! &nbsp;Congratulations to the winner, who won Steam Cash as a prize.</p>
<p>Here's the Grand Finals between NasalCongestion and Deadbones.</p>

<p>These matches were EXTREEEEEMELY close and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. &nbsp;Amazing play!</p>
