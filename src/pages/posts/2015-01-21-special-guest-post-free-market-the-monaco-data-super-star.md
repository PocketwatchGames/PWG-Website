<p>Hello readers, I am <b>Free Market</b>, a.k.a. Perfect Competition. I've been playing Monaco since May, 2013. I was introduced to speedrunning in Monaco by ending up in the right public lobbies with the right players. I had a lot of fun, but I started to wonder how we could increase the interaction between speedrunners.</p>

<p>I started off by creating a list of my friend's all-time records, written out by hand and posted to our Steam group. This was inefficient, to say the least, and I resolved not to do it again if I had to do it by hand. I started brainstorming about how one could automate the process, and eventually the pieces came together for me to launch my personal project in May, 2014.</p>

<p>Since then, I've been collecting leaderboard data weekly and preparing&nbsp;<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/113020/discussions/0/620700960964754884/">something of a summary</a>&nbsp;of the activity in the Monaco speedrunning community. But I quickly realized that I could do a lot more than just these summaries; having access to past and present leaderboard data opened up new opportunities to visualize the Monaco community. I've created&nbsp;<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/113020/discussions/0/522728814708971024/">unofficial Monaco leaderboards</a>, charted how players set&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/a/xypo4">new records</a>&nbsp;over time, showed&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/a/AHU2F">who has been playing with whom</a>, and even taken a look at the&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/a/6auyB">thousands of records</a>&nbsp;no one ever looks at.</p>

<p>This has attracted a bit of attention, and the developers of Monaco even threw their support behind some of my work. Just before Christmas, I got an awesome gift in the form of assistance from Andy Nguyen setting up a new, much more efficient system to collect leaderboard data. </p>
<p>In celebration of the new possibilities, I've prepared a <b>series of articles</b> highlighting the best of what I've learned looking at the leaderboards, and it's being featured here, officially, by Pocketwatch Games.&nbsp;I hope this is just a taste of even more good things to come.</p>
<p>More coming soon...</p>
