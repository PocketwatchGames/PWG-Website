## The Pocketwatch Team Expands!

Adam DeGrandis was our artist for Monaco: What's Yours is Mine and he is making a triumphant return to Pocketwatch Games to help guide the artistic vision. Adam's role will define the direction of the game so that every aspect of LEADtoFIRE will tie together thematically.

Over the last few months, we have seen more amazing artwork from our other artist, Jerome Jacinto, but there's so much more to be done. We can now take major steps towards improving branding, UI, and the overall presentation of the game.

## LEADtoFIRE Gameplay Updates

**Adventure Awaits! (Single Player Missions)**

We have taken our first steps towards expanding LtF beyond competitive multiplayer. A simple tutorial mission has been added to the game and we have already started working on more in-depth single player missions. We plan to have missions explore a variety of objectives and mission types. One meta concept we want to explore is the idea that the campaign will be ever changing, reacting to the choices you make on the battlefield.

Here's a first look at our work in progress for a very popular mission type. Defend your base!

In this early mission, you fight off ever increasing waves of enemies as you try to keep your base alive. This is just a simple concept for the types of missions we can do, so keep on the lookout for more info in the future!

**There Will Be Blood! (Particle Effects)**

We've recently implemented a system that allows for generated particle effects. Particles really increase the player feedback for the various events that happen in the game, improving the player feel.

So much blood! Oh the brutality! Remember, this is just an alpha, so the presentation of it will be improved later.

##Twitch Highlight of the Week

We ran another 8-player tournament for Steam cash this last week with a lot of fresh new faces. This week's highlight showcases Kyro, who got into the alpha minutes before the tournament and literally played his first game live on stream.

Even though the stakes were high, this first timer shocked everyone with his performance, showing just how easy LEADtoFIRE is to pick up and play. I can only imagine Kyro becoming a stronger contender as he continues to play.

##Community Spotlight - Zanaro

This week, our featured community member is none other than Zanaro, who has the most tournament winnings under his belt. Those of you who follow our streams will know that week after week he presents the most consistent competitive play, and has proven to be one of the best LTF players of all time.

Here's what he has to say:

> LEADtoFIRE. A game I only saw because of a Twitch spotlight I heard about on a random forum I don't frequent anymore. It is a rather simple game that has had its ups and downs, its fair share of meta changes, but throughout all of these differences, it has kept the same fundamentals that the developers started with; simple, fast paced, fun. I respect that a lot. I do not play this game to be good at it, I am good at the game because I play it, and the same can be said for anyone who picks LtF up. Though the previous is a fairly true statement, I do strive to be the best at LtF because of the friendship I have with the developers. The more I play, the better I play, the better this game will become. There's also prizes involved with being good, but that's besides the point :)
