Hi folks, Andy Schatz here. Got a fun little peek into our development process here:

The first thing [Adam deGrandis](http://blog.pocketwatchgames.com/post/111989150076/bi-weekly-recap-4-first-steps-towards-single) did since joining the team was to have us take a few steps back into pre-production, and get a better handle on our characters and art style. So Jerome went back to the drawing board (literally) on our four main characters.

So I produced a series of VERBAL sketches (choppily written, intentionally so), from which Jerome produced a series of VISUAL sketches. Enjoy!

**Arroyo Bellafide (Aristocrat)**
![Bellafide](http://i.imgur.com/id4Ombc.png)

Believes in the free market. Started life poor, his boxing talents made him rich. Believes that people should pull themselves up by their bootstraps, and looks down on the poor. Loves his family, protective of those around him. Willing to pay top dollar to hire mercenaries to fight the church, as he doesn’t believe in autocratic rule. He started the revolution, with the help of [Commoner leader], after the church selected his son to be killed to feed the people. Believes himself a hero. Maybe he is.

**Commoner (name TBD) (Commoner)**
![Commoner](http://i.imgur.com/R3fGi7G.png)

Is a Gypsy, plays music. A leader amongst her community, and was willing to give up an arm and a tail to feed her people. Wants democracy instead of church rule, but is blind to the fact that “power to the people” means “mob rule”. Is a rule breaker. Explicitly political. Believes that “human nature” is essentially good, but paradoxically believes that all those who disagree with her are essentially selfish. Possibly drunk. Certainly wild.

**Archimedes (Clergy)**
![Archimedes](http://i.imgur.com/RiUEuf3.jpg)

Has a messiah complex. Is second in command to the senile church leader. Believes he and his cohorts are holy. Is not squeamish about blood. Requires sacrifice of others, but is not willing to give it of himself (although he believes his devotion to the church is its own sacrifice). Condescending but not haughty. The name Archimedes was granted upon entry into the clergy. Represents “the old world”. Secretly, a slave to temptation, as the church confiscates the possessions of those selected to be slaughtered to feed the people. The church went into hiding once the war began, and has been seeking old allies to help them return to power. Believes absolutely that the brutal practices of the church make the world a better place. May in fact by right.

**Hopper (name TBD?) (Police)**
![Hopper](http://i.imgur.com/klF191k.jpg)

Wants order at all costs. Can’t stand rabble rousers. Prior to the war, she had her spies everywhere. She demands absolute loyalty. The war is chaos, and for her it’s an opportunity to increase her hold on the populace. Will kill anyone who steps out of line. Has access to government technology. Believes that ending the war quickly will make the world a better place, regardless of the winner.
