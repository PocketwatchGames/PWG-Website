**Who’s Playing with Whom??**

Monaco has an interesting player community. I have only experienced a small part of it, in my time playing the game. But I still had questions about the community at large and how people play with one another, and in particular how the fastest players interact with one another. Once again, I turned to the leaderboard data to get a bigger picture.

These [graphs](http://imgur.com/a/75khM) help to illustrate how the Enhanced Multiplayer community interacts.

Each player holding a top-20 ranked Enhanced Multiplayer entry, on any level, gets a node on the first graph:

[![Top-20 Ranked Enhanced Multiplayer](http://i.imgur.com/9Xo3c4G.png "Top-20 Ranked Enhanced Multiplayer")](http://i.imgur.com/9Xo3c4G.png)

The circle around their name illustrates how many records they hold; darker and thicker circles are more top-50 ranked all-time entries, up to a total of 48. Then, each player gets a pair of lines connecting them with every player with whom they share a record. One end has an arrow, the target player, and the other just touches a circle, the originating player. The lines and arrows are thicker based on the fraction of the originating player’s entries are shared by the target player. So a very broad line indicates that almost all the originating player’s entries involve the target player.

Looking at the graph, we see a lot of single players. Because this is a multiplayer graph, we can infer that these are orphaned players. Maybe they got a few all-times as long as a year ago, but stopped playing. Then, the players they shared records with kept playing and got new all-times, leaving the old-timers orphaned on the graph.

[![Isolated Groups](http://imgur.com/cQdHRiw.png "Isolated Groups")](http://imgur.com/cQdHRiw.png)

There are also the isolated groups of players around the edges. These groups in a triangle or x-shape all play a lot with each other, shown by the very large arrows between them, but not-at-all with other top-20 players, shown by the lack of connections to people outside their group.

[![Branches](http://imgur.com/uHu5uCk.png "Branches")](http://imgur.com/uHu5uCk.png)

Then, there is the massive tangle of players in the middle, with a few branches splitting off the group towards the outside. At the end of these branches, we see players who got one or two all-times with a more active player. If you look at the lines, the ones going toward the main tree are very thick, because the outside players have very few entries, but the lines going out to the periphery are very thin, because the more active players have a lot of records and share them with more players.

The first graph was very cluttered, so let’s trim a few of the outer branches away by excluding players with fewer than twenty top-50 ranked all-times:

[![Trimmed Graph](http://i.imgur.com/P56AVFz.png "Trimmed Graph")](http://i.imgur.com/P56AVFz.png)

This is interesting because we start to see another type of serious Monaco player: the one who plays a lot with one or two friends, creating very thick arrows between them. An example might be Giu and Starthur, or Durgobach and Annexed. At the same time, they have a handful of records they share with other players, so they are still connected to the rest of the tree.

[![Friends](http://i.imgur.com/vq1kcXZ.png "Friends")](http://i.imgur.com/vq1kcXZ.png)

Cutting down to only the players with more than forty top-50 ranked all-times shows us some of the best multiplayer speedrunners in the community. Most of them not only play a lot, but play with a lot of different people. Maybe they have a lot of friends, or maybe they meet new people using a Steam group. Or maybe they’ve been playing so long that they have older records with one group of friends and newer records with a completely different group. It creates a very dense web of connections.

These are the players who have a top-50 ranked all-time on every official map in Enhanced Mode. One of the neat things you can see with a graph this small is that everyone shares at least one record with everyone else, except, apparently, Mr. U and KYGON! Just a coincidence, I hope!
