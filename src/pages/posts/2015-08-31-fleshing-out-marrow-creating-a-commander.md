title: "Fleshing Out “Marrow”: Creating a Commander"
---

Hello! Before I share insight regarding what I worked on in the game, I’d like to formally introduce myself. I’m Jerome Jacinto, the artist working on unit designs and their portraits. I’m a freelance artist based in the Philippines.

If you happen to have seen my artworks online, you’ll see I draw a lot of redwall and other animal-related stuff. That’s what landed me this awesome project. To create a world where Redwall meets WW1 vibe, that’s something I couldn’t turn down! For what it’s worth, I’m a practitioner of parkour and martial arts as well.

Today, I’m going to talk about Marrow, the red faction’s commander, her humble beginnings and how she evolved into her final iteration.

Marrow first sprang to life in Tooth and Tail’s first poster, back when the game was known as Lead to Fire.

The poster focuses on the commander of the commoner faction, standing atop a chaotic pile of revolutionaries. Originally, the commanding officer’s initial fleeting design was generic at best, and also male.

If I compare it to the present designs of the game’s units, it’d be easy to mistake him as just a unit himself.

Since the game’s lore takes inspiration from World War 1 and the Russian Revolution, Andy Schatz wanted to make sure each commander was drawn from famous revolutionaries (or their adversaries). Inspired by the famous Delacroix painting, Liberty Leading the People, Marrow is more than just a character: she represents an ideal.

From here, I’m going to walk you through her design evolution. As you can see in the poster above, Marrow started with a complete set of limbs.

But let’s leave that particular topic about her missing limb alone for now. For a long while, her design stayed the way it is.

At one point, we decided to change the general proportions of the commanders into something more animalistic, like how the mice and rats were drawn in the animated movie Secret of NIMH, to keep in line with Adam deGrandis’ general direction of all the units looking beastial.

After a few more iterations, we decided that Marrow needed more unique detail to make her less generic.

Marrow is wild, she is possibly drunk, and definitely enraged. Her outfit is inspired by Gypsy clothing. And we added a major piece to her backstory: as the leader of the poor and starving masses, she cut off her own arm to feed her people. That lead us to her final appearance:

Until we designed her amputated arm, we had been calling her CoCo, short for Commoner Commander. Her self-sacrifice inspired her name: Marrow has come a long ways from her humble beginnings. She’s finally ready for the revolution!
