title: "Nothing New Under the Sunray Shader: The Inspirations of Tooth and Tail’s Visual Style"
---

While we were doing the stream on the day of the art announcement, PC Gamer asked a really great question. It went something like, “can you talk about the C&C influence?”. Great question, though one I wasn’t fully prepared to answer. I gave a round-about answer and carried on, but I realized it’d be a great topic for a blog post when I was thinking about it later. There’s the bullet points of inspiration that are easy to rattle off, but the makers of all of THAT stuff were looking at things too, and making decisions based on what others were doing at the time. Because of that, there are strands of DNA that can be traced back through generations and generations of creative work. It can be pretty interesting to follow that stuff back. At very least, you’ll learn a few interesting tidbits, but ideally, you’ll gain a deeper appreciation of the stuff you love, and maybe even an acceptance of stuff you dislike. And that helps you sleep better, my sweet petites.

Now some of you might say, “who cares, just show me some pretty pictures”, and that’s cool. There will be plenty of pretty pictures. BUT! I’m hoping others level up their knowledge and be excited to learn more about the insane, roller coaster-y, zig-zaggy history that’s propping up all those pretty pictures.

Ok. The look of Tooth and Tail is a mashup of three core pillars:

1. Classic works that feature animals with society, like [The Secret of NIMH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCAiKsLLprU) and [Redwall](https://www.google.com/search?q=Redwall&safe=off&biw=1920&bih=955&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMI24CXvdnoxwIVB3-SCh0ILgQe)
2. Classic computer and arcade games, especially the original [Command & Conquer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx1igDCbgq8) and [Red Alert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCzb84gqATk)
3. Features in modern game art, like shaders and dynamically generated content

As I mentioned in a previous entry, super painter Jerome Jacinto planted the initial seeds that grew into our current look, and it was his work based on the Redwall series that Andy S. first saw. Let’s look at some of his art, yeah?

Pretty great, right? Well, while the subject matter of these is the Redwall series, how Jerome paints it (and tons of other stuff) is pretty clearly inspired by the visual style of The Secret of NIMH. Let’s take a look at a few stills of that, just for reference.

Also pretty great, right? Here’s where the weave starts to get a little denser. The Secret of NIHM was directed by a former Disney artist named [Don Bluth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bluth). If you love animation, you should read up on him. He’s a master. Bluth split from Disney because he wanted to tackle darker material than Disney would ever attempt. So, right there, we have a classic type of conflict in the creative world. Here’s a master at his craft who doesn’t like how studio X does things, and wants to head off in a different, fresh direction. It’s the same thing that a lot of indie developers were saying ten or fifteen years ago, except then it was “I don’t like how EA (or Activision or whoever) is doing things, I want to make this different idea I have”.

I don’t know the details of the visual development of NIMH itself, but I’d be shocked if people familiar with the process said they never looked at work by the old masters who worked in [tenebrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenebrism). Simply put, tenebrism is a style of painting developed post-renaissance (the Baroque period) that features really dramatic light and shadow. It also tends to feature really dramatic (and sometimes violent or gory) subject matter. Here’s “The Taking of Christ”, by Caravaggio.

WELL LOOK AT THAT! Looks pretty effin’ similar to NIMH, right? So let’s think about the lineage here. [A guy in Kansas City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney) started a studio to produce this newish art form called animation and managed to turn it into an empire that made musicals about talking animals. Another guy who worked for that studio thought that they were cranking stuff out using a stale format and decided there were more interesting kinds of animation to make. When it came time to prove himself, he mashed his animation training together with [insane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Beheading_Holofernes_%28Caravaggio%29) [paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Devouring_His_Son) that were made hundreds of years ago and ended up directing an Emmy winning film. That film became a thing that influenced artists the world over, including a martial arts and parkour enthusiast in the Philippines. That inspiration fueled a bunch of paintings based on a series of books, and [some asshole in San Diego](https://twitter.com/andyschatz) discovered them and offered the artist a gig.

Little pieces of all of those twists and turns are embedded in the look of Tooth and Tail. Admittedly, though, it’s just much easier to say “the game is influenced by classic works that feature animals with society, like The Secret of NIMH and Redwall”. And here’s the really interesting part; Every creative work you love is similarly dense! Every game, every movie, every comic, every band… everything.

Alright, let’s move onto the second pillar -classic strategy games - and with it, a tale of different kind of decision making.

![Redwall](http://i.imgur.com/lvq69ty.jpg)

Andy S. was the first to suggest we play with the possibility of heading in a pixel direction, which I was immediately on board with. As I said before, the original C&C is the game that made me want to be a developer, and the opportunity to pay homage to it in a significant way was irresistible to me. And just like with the previous pillar, this one has some interesting history.

At this point, it’s hard for fans to imagine Command & Conquer as anything but the fight between heavy-hitting GDI and the quick and stealthy Brotherhood of Nod, but the game actually started with a fantasy setting. The jump to a real-world setting was a business decision, made to help the final game stand apart from [competitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft). That decision wasn’t solely a financial thing, though; it had some interesting visual potential. Remember that Desert Storm, a conflict that featured unparalleled media coverage, happened only a few years before, and the imagery that went along with it was still fresh in people’s minds. News anchors issuing reports in front of tan humvees and tanks. Anti aircraft rounds filling the sky in night vision footage of bombing runs. Footage of cruise missiles flying directly at their target before the feed cuts at the point of impact.

The humanity in war gets harder and harder to see as the technology gets more advanced, though, and the technology used in the conflict was state-of-the-art. The figures in a satellite feed of a raid on the ground are shaped like people, but they don’t feel like people. You can identify them AS people, but you don’t identify WITH them. There are some incredibly complex philosophical issues at play here, but at very least, it’s a really potent setting for a strategy game.

One of the great, if understated, benefits of this setting was that it offers a clean explanation for the game’s original 320x240 resolution; this was a satellite feed of a battle in process. You’re not actually there, hovering above the world. You’re a commander who’s utilizing the best technology of the time to direct the events on the ground from an undisclosed location. For you, the battle is real-time chess rather than a threat to your life, and the pieces on your digital chessboard are almost an abstraction. These aren’t people, they’re tools to get a job done. But in that abstraction, we actually find some really juicy aesthetic meat. And what’s more, it’s meat that has interesting parallels in the famous works of the past.

I remember vividly the first time I saw the flamethrower infantry, which I’ll illustrate here the best I can. (thanks [fraps](http://www.fraps.com/) and [Tiberian Dawn Online](http://cncnet.org/tiberian-dawn)) There I was, building up my base, when these little Nod guys with what looked like white backpacks approached a little squad of my rifle infantry. “Oh who are these guys”?

![Redwall](http://i.imgur.com/ps00RkL.gif)

“OH MY HEAD, WHAT, THAT WAS AWESOME!,” I probably said out loud, with a total lack of sympathy for my now crispy soldiers. After some maneuvering, the nod assault was stopped.

![Redwall](http://i.imgur.com/pyMaBO3.gif)

“AHHH HE BLEW UP, THAT IS SO COOL!”

And it was. It was so cool. The lack of resolution meant that the infantry in the game had to be boiled down to broad strokes. There was no room for detail, only gesture. But if you, as an artist, embrace those kinds of tight restrictions, you sometimes are able to make work that’s vastly superior to work that allows for more details, because it opens the door to greater creative interpretation. It’s no longer fact-based reporting of what something looks like. You’re describing what something feels like it should looks like. You’re potentially able to hit a more emotional, visceral tone. Something that reads like, “This might not be fact, but damned if it doesn’t feel true. And holy hell, does it look great.”

The history of art is full of this less-is-more approach. Impressionism is a great example. While the impressionists strove to accurately depict light, the fine detail of previous art movements is no where to be found. These paintings are about what a moment feels like, and not the (for example) exact pattern of lace on some guy’s collar. And if you get close, the tiny little brushstrokes that are a common feature of the style start to feel like pixels. It’s a pretty neat parallel.

![Redwall](http://i.imgur.com/RqAeDxn.jpg)

So, the point is that in reducing the fidelity of something we’re making, we can actually find ways to say more… or at least we’re forced to find a more interesting way to say what we’re trying to say. But ultimately, I’m talking about a game we’re making in 2015. Westwood found an interesting way to explain its low resolution, but I’m going to guess they weren’t thinking of low-resolution as an aesthetic choice. After all, the subsequent entries in the series featured graphics that were as fancy as the tech of the day allowed. And while our decision to go with pixels is a conscious choice, we also didn’t want to get bogged down the general pixel nostalgia party that’s common in games these days. Just like Westwood deciding to go with a modern setting to help set it apart from it’s competitors, we wanted to be sure that our game couldn’t be written off as “just another pixel art indie game”.

And that brings us to our third pillar; modern art tech. This is going to be a future topic I dedicate an entire blog to so I’ll just give a brief summary here and save the extended info for later.

It’s tempting to think of full screen shaders/effects as random eye-candy that just make things look more zazzy - and if we’re being honest, that’s what they sometimes are - but I think in experienced hands, they become a tool that can be used with precision to achieve a specific result. Case in point, most of shaders or effects we have serve a specific purpose. We have a color shifter that acts as fake lighting, allowing us to have environments with varied moods. We have a sunray shader and cloud shadow shader that work to widen the value range, resulting in more dark darks and bright brights (another touch of tenebrism?…). And we use a “perturb filter” on things like shorelines and roads, so we can get those elements to feel organic without the need of a bunch of tile/art production. It’s a mega time saver.

![Redwall](http://i.imgur.com/LLwssuz.jpg)

These things were all directly influenced from games we’ve played or made in the past. The color shifter is based on a standard photoshop process for adding greater color variation in static paintings, but similar shaders are used in countless games. Moreover, if we’re tracing the effect back, we can look at putting colored scrims over lights in film or on stage as the precursor. Sunrays and cloud shadows in games are, at this point, dinosaur effects. I can’t remember the first time I saw them in action, but it was easily over 10 or 15 years ago at this point. And the perturb filter we use is just an in-game version of an old photoshop process used for painting textures; it’s similar to the way I make paint that’s flaking off a surface.

Of course, I haven’t mentioned Andy’s pride and joy, the water shader. Well, as I said before, sometimes effects are just there to make a scene look more zazzy. Such is the case with our water shader, which is effectively a 3d water shader placed in an 2d/iso environment. Finally, the last big effect is the [tilt shift blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt%E2%80%93shift_photograph), and in talking about this, we have our final takeaway.

We used to have a vignette effect - basically, an effect that darkened the edges of the screen - that was designed to help draw the player’s eye toward the center of the screen. It was crushing the overall vividness of the scene, though, so we needed to come up with a new way to direct the player’s gaze. Tilt-shift was suggested as we brainstormed. I was familiar with the effect from countless photographers who use it in their work, as well as a single game that used it to great effect; the oft-maligned SimCity. Say what you will about that game, the tilt shift did a great job at making your city feel like a toy at the same time it felt like a bustling metropolis. We all agreed it was worth trying and we had it in game a day later, looking and working great. The point is that all games, even ones that you might think “sucks worse than the plague” or “looks like ass balls, 2/10”, have rich histories, or at least something to teach us.

But for the record, the latest SimCity was sincerely great, and people who derided it suck worse the than plague.
