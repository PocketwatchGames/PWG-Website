title: "Building Bellafide: Creating a Commander"
---

Hi again, [Jerome](http://chichapie.deviantart.com/) here. Today I’ll be sharing insight regarding our next commander, Arroyo Bellafide. The leader of the Aristocrats went through a lot of iterations, much more than Marrow.

In making his first portrait, the first guideline I had for illustrating Bellafide was an aristocrat, leading a revolution against the church for killing his son.

This portrait is the very first image of him, and at the time we liked him the way he is. Cultured and quite regal in his own way, with an expression filled with righteous determination. Facial structure was inspired by the actor Pete Postlethwaite, probably most famous for playing Kaiser Soze in The Usual Suspects:

For his in-game appearance, we started with this sprite:

The character was too big on screen, though, and so in shrinking him we went with more chibi-like body/head proportions so as to maintain detail on his face.

While we liked this art, many people mistook the animal for a lion, few people saw him as a rat. So, after sticking with this art style for months, we took a sharp left turn as we reinvented the art style with a style more reminiscent of Don Bluth and The Secret of Nimh.

The version of Bellafide fit our art style, but lacked a unique personality in terms of his body and face. So, we sent him to the gym with an unlimited membership.

Anatomy-wise, we almost got what we were looking for, but his outfit still didn’t sit well with us. He was reading as a military man rather than an aristocrat. After a long while, Andy Schatz showed me pictures of Theodore Roosevelt.

Teddy became the new peg for finalizing Bellafide’s design. It wasn’t enough that he is very built physically, his outfit also needed to tell a story. Roosevelt’s face, his facial hair, his glasses, and his sturdy frame, became the strongest factors in getting Bellafide right.
