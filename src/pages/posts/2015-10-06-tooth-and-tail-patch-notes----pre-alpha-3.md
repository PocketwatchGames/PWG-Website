#Pre-Alpha 3

In this patch, many changes have been made to several units in order to help improve their uniqueness on the battlefield. This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.pocketwatchgames.com/chat.html).

##Gameplay

**New Unit Changes**

> We made a big push to improve the controls and quality of life for many of the units. We also added improvements to their strategic diversity, as opposed to having single note specialists.
