#Pre-Alpha 4

After the last patch introduced so many drastic changes to the unit design, we had to follow up with the challenge of balancing the game. The meta changed drastically and as a result, we have implemented major balance changes to many of the units.

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.pocketwatchgames.com/chat.html).
