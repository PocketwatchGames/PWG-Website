##Gameplay

We are testing out an experimental change to 2 units to see if it improves the gameplay.

- Mole has been made into a 40/30 Stealth and Melee unit.
- Chameleon has been changed into 15/30 Summon unit with 10 second build time.

> This change was made to see if we could improve how T1 interacts with itself, as well as increase the viability of early game offense.

- Artillery Cannon DEF decreased to 20, down from 30
- Sniper Ballon DEF decreased to 25, down from 30
- Toad attack cast time increased to .5, up from .25
- Toads no longer explode on death
- Commanders can no longer rally troops while burrowing
- A new default deck has been assigned to new players, this deck consists of: Toad, Squirrel, Falcon, Ferret, Boar, Machine Gun, Barbed Wire
- You can no longer build HQs while dead
- Units with flying now instantly enter a flying state upon being created, rather than over 1 second
- 2v2 skirmish added
- Building and selling structures now occurs on button press down, rather than on release
- Units will no longer fire if they were casting when they die
