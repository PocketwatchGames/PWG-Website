title: "Hatching “Hopper”: Creating a Commander"
---

In my previous post, I talked about how Bellafide evolved from an idea to a character of his own. Today, we’ll tackle Hopper: The ruthless leader of the secret police.

While her faction is now known as the secret police, Hopper once was the commander of the “military” faction. She believed in peace through order, despite the costs. This naturally makes Hopper and her faction to be neutral to all of the factions’ causes.

Here's our first attempt at drawing her in game as well as her portrait.

Per Schatz’s direction, Hopper was also supposed to be somewhat physically attractive. Designing a physically attractive rat without sexualizing her was a tall order.

For this original design, we used a combination of General MacArthur (and his corn cob pipe), and Brigadier General Nicky Moffat.

For a time, we went along with this version of Hopper. But with both Marrow and Bellafide being one of the righteous leaders as well, it ruins the alignment balance, leaving the 4th commander, Archimedes of the religious faction, to be the ‘villain’ and the only opposing force against the majority.

Based on that issue, we agreed on the idea of turning her into a ruthless disciplinarian. This new version of Hopper is now more cruel, calculating and obsessed with order through fear and indiscriminate control. She commands the secret police, responsible for secret killings, tortures etc…

While her motivation of “peace through security” remains, Hopper’s primary desire is to quell the uprising by killing the revolutionaries, making her the type of villain who is driven by a dark but righteous worldview.
