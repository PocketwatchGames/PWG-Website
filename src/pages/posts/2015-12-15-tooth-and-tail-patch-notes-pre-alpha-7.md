- Machine gun turret now has 40 HP, down from 50
- Landmines are now 3x3 AOE instead of single target
- Farm pigs are now 15 DEF, down from 25
- New HQ expansions now cost 60 food, down from 120

> Increasing the time it takes for the toad to explode is actually a buff according to our playtesting. With an instantaneous explosion, you had a lot of instances in which multiple toads would explode on a single target, greatly increasing the chances of overlapping charges.
