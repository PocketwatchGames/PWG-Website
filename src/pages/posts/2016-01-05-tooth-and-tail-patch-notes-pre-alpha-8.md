#Pre-Alpha 8

Patch 8 is a big landmark for us because it contains the remaining unit animations in Tooth and Tail. Also included are a slew of new particle effects and some big gameplay changes! This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.pocketwatchgames.com/chat.html).

##Gameplay

- Army size is now limited to 6 units

> Our goal for lowering army size is to increase the amount of strategy that goes into deciding your army composition, so you will have to make some serious choices now.

- Landmines now do 10 ATK over a 3x3 area instead of 50 ATK to a single unit

> Targeting a single unit made landmines ineffective because it was not entirely predictable what unit would be hit by the landmine. We also wanted to increase the amount of anti-T1 options because of how prevalent T1s are in the game.

- 2v2 maps have been made smaller for shorter game length and improved performance
- Fixed a bug that would cause AOE damage to do friendly fire damage
- Updated the description of the Minigun and Machine Gun
- Moles are now 10 ATK and 30 DEF, down from 15 ATK and 35 DEF
- Lizards are now 10 DEF, down from 15 DEF
