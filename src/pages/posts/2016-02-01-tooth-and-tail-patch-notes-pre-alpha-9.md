##Environment

[![New Environment](http://i.imgur.com/fNKbPcB.jpg "New Environment")](http://i.imgur.com/fNKbPcB.jpg)

##Gameplay

- Wolf attack damage buff now lasts for 4, down from 5
- Wolf attack damage buff colldown increased to 19, up from 9
- Wolf attack damage bonus increased to 20, up from 10

> The point of these changes to the Wolf were to improve how a player could strategize versus the Wolf. Before, the buff seemed to last persistently throughout fights, having very little downtime. This made the Wolf feel more like a passive buff. Now, the Wolf's benefit comes in short bursts of tremendous power. Attack the Wolf in between buffs to capitalize on its weakness.

- Toads are now have 15 DEF, up from 10
