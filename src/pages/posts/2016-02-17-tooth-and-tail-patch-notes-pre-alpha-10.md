#Pre-Alpha 10

This patch is a bit smaller than usual because we are working on a feature for Tooth and Tail that we can't quite reveal yet. Keen alpha testers will already know what this feature is, but fear not, you will all be able to see what we are working on in due time.

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.pocketwatchgames.com/chat.html).

##Gameplay

[![Sample Map](http://i.imgur.com/eK7T0iD.png "Sample Map")](http://i.imgur.com/eK7T0iD.png)

- New 1v1 Map Generation

> We are experimenting with a new map generation model. Maps have been made slightly smaller and more dense. This change was designed to reduce play times which were averaging slightly longer than we would like. We also hope that making the maps more dense that the variation between each map will increase.

- Skunk gas grenades now last 30 seconds, down from 60 seconds
- Boar is now 20 ATK / 70 DEF, down from 25 ATK / 80 DEF
- Fox is now 50 ATK / 50 DEF, up from 40 ATK / 40 DEF
- Falcon DEF increased to 20, up from 15
- Snake DEF increased to 30, up from 25
- HQs have been renamed to Gristmills
- Fixed a bug that caused Toads to do too much damage
