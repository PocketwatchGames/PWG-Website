##Tooth and Tail @ GDC

GDC was so much fun! We managed to get the team together and show the game off to a lot of great press. Here's an early look at what some of them have to say.

##What press has to say

> "Tooth and Tail seems like one of those concepts where you think “that would be cool if someone could pull it off, but there’s no way.” But Pocketwatch Games has found a way." -[PC Gamer](http://www.pcgamer.com/this-weeks-highs-and-lows-in-pc-gaming_march18_2016/ "Highs and Lows in PC Gaming")

##Tooth and Tail @ THE MIX

On the first day, we showed Tooth and Tail at the MIX, which was hosted at the IGN offices. On a fun note, we showed Monaco at the very first MIX event 5 years ago. The event sure has grown in size!
