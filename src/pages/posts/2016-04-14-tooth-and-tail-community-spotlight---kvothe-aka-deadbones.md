#Community Spotlight

The return of our Community Spotlight features one of our most dedicated fans, who has been with the Tooth and Tail alpha through it's many iterations. He's constantly adapting his strategy to stay at his best despite all the ongoing changes to the game. Here's what he has to say.

##Kvothe

"Roughly 18 months ago a group of friends bought a humble bundle which included, among others, Monaco. This led one of said friends to find Tooth and Tail, (then LEADtoFIRE), which he promptly introduced me to. Since then I've gotten over 800 hours registered in the game on Steam and I've gotten introduced to one of the best communities I've ever been part of, as well as one of the best games I've played in my life. The combination of strategy and fast paced matches makes for an incredibly intense experience while still being more approachable than most other games in the genre."

##A dire situation in need of a hero!

Here's a recent clip showing off Kvothe's ability to make the best of a bad situation. Near the end, he tackles 2 opponents at the same time with just a single unit.
