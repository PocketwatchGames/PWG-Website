- Players and units can now swim!
- Water slows players and units by 50% movement speed
- Swimming particle effects added
- Splash effects added
- Reflections to water added
- Swimming animations added
- Players cannot burrow home through water

**Balance**

- A 0.25 second cast time on all units has been removed for faster player response times

> There was a built in quarter second delay in all combat that has just been removed. This should improve the response times for all combat

- Many units have had their cooldowns reduced from 2.5 seconds, to 2 seconds

> When we used to be a Damage Over 5 Seconds system, we had all "burst" units operate at 1 shot every 2.5 seconds, to make the math "easier". Since then, we have converted to a Damage Per 1 Second system, and as a result, we have converted all long cooldowns to 2 seconds

> The affected units are: Ferret, Pigeon, Falcon, Chameleon, Fox, Sniper Balloon, Artillery Cannon

- Artillery Cannon now fires 3 total shots over 1.5 seconds, then reloads for 4.5 seconds. Each bullet will do 2x its ATK value.
- Sniper Balloon and Fox now fire 1 shot every 2 seconds. Each bullet is now 2x its ATK value.
- Chameleons now Hammer once every 2 seconds. Each hit is now 2x its ATK value.
- Ferrets now fire once every 2 seconds. Each bullet is now 2x its ATK value.
- Pigeons now heal once every 2 seconds. The heal effect lasts 2 seconds.

- Artillery Cannon is now 5 ATK, down from 12
- Wolf now add +5 ATK on buff, up from +4
- Mice from Owls are now now 3/15, down from 4/15
- Units can no longer have 0 health, it is rounded up to 1 for fractional damage
- Chameleons now have 30 DEF. up from 20
- Toads now have 10 DEF, down from 15
- Skunks now have 30 DEF, up from 25
- Ferrets now have 20 DEF, up from 15
- Snakes now have 30 DEF, up from 25
- Landmines now have 10 ATK, up from 5
- Falcons are now 3 ATK, down from 4

> While this seems like a nerf, we also just reduced their reload cooldown time by 0.5 seconds, which should offset this change.
