#Community Spotlight

On this spotlight, we are really proud to talk about one of the most incredibly helpful members of our community. When CaptnFog joined the community, he quickly started thinking outside the box and brought together what would be our first major tournament for Tooth and Tail called [Clash of Comrades](https://www.facebook.com/ClashOfComrades/).

CaptnFog blew us all away when he contacted us during PAX East. Local to Boston, CaptnFog came out to meet us at the convention, only to volunteer to help at the booth for the whole show. We are so grateful for all your help CaptnFog, you really saved us that weekend.

##Clash of Comrades

Clash of Comrades is a bi-monthly tournament for players of the game Tooth and Tail. The aim of CoC is to provide friendly competition, foster a larger sense of community, and aid in the development and testing of the game. Each tournament takes place over an entire month, with the last weekend featuring a streamed grand finals bracket of the top 8 players of the month.

Check out the current Top 8 brackets for Clash of Comrades [HERE](http://challonge.com/ClashOfComradesMayMayhem)

And here's a video of CaptnFog and Hunter0 livecasting a Tournament Qualifiers match between LUF and CalixJumi.

##CaptnFog

"Tooth and Tail scratches an itch I've had for a long, long, time. I love controlling armies, and watching hordes of units decimate my enemy’s base. What I don’t love is all the busywork in a typical Real Time Strategy game. It manages to stress me out so much that I stop enjoying the match. Tooth and Tail hits a sweet spot with lots of action and just enough depth. Add on to that the beautiful art style, with scenes that remind me of autumn hikes in Maine, and WWI animal characters, and you’ve got me hooked. I’m showing the game to everyone I know, and doing all I can to help the community flourish so other people can enjoy this game."
