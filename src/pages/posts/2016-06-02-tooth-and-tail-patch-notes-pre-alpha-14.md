#Pre-Alpha 14

We are super happy to announce that ZenoAkoop is the winner of the first big Tooth and Tail Tournament. The Tournament was May Mayhem and was ran by CaptnFog. This is a great help to us because it let us know the state of the games balance in heavily competitive matches. As a result, we have some drastic balance changes which could shake up the game in interesting ways.

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.pocketwatchgames.com/chat.html).
