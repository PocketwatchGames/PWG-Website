#Community Spotlight

On this community spotlight we want to thank Glyde for his creative contributions to Tooth and Tail. For the past several months, we have been regularly releasing patches with improvements to the gameplay and balance of the game. Our most passionate players have followed these notes in hopes to get the best understanding of the current state of the game.

Glyde went above and beyond and decided to do a thematic re-write of our patch notes with fan-infused flair. As a result, we have the Warren Weekly, a newspaper summarizing our patch notes written in the world of Tooth and Tail.

The Warren Weekly is a fictional newspaper that recreates and explains the patch note changes through stories and articles set in the World of Tooth and Tail.

Here's the most recent edition, including balance changes for Patch Notes 14.

> I am a non-conformist and explorer at heart so I take no pleasure in doing something many people have already done before. Off-meta compositions make the game more interesting for me and probably for those who play against me as well and a game's supposed to fun, right? so why not? Enter Kasha, the Farmhand, aka the Fox. She's arguably the most micro intensive unit and is super fun to play in my opinion. She may not the best in every situation but I've had games where Kasha single-handedly won me games I would have otherwise lost. Picking units like the Fox and using weird but otherwise fun composition may not always win you the game, but it keeps the game fresh and interesting, both for myself and my oppoent.
