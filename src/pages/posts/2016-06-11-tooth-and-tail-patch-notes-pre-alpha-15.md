#Pre-Alpha 15

Wow what a week! We made some big changes last week to the balance of the game with the goal of bringing forward some new strategies. Being a tight knit community, we are very fortunate because we can quickly get feedback from our most passionate players. To make things easier, we took a poll from our best players. It's always interesting to note how challenging balancing can be.

The latest balance changes are based upon this feedback.

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.pocketwatchgames.com/chat.html).
