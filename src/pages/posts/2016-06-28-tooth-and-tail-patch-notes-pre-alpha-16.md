#Pre-Alpha 16

This week's patch is a little light on content, but under the hood we have done a lot of work in preparation for Campaign Mode. This should open the door to a lot of fun possibilities with single player and we are looking forward to revealing more about it soon. :)

There are some light balance changes based on feedback, but they should have a real effect on the game.

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.pocketwatchgames.com/chat.html).

##Gameplay

**Balance**

- Inmate #43B is now 50 DEF, down from 70
- Inmate #43B is now 20 ATK, down from 30
- Inmate #43B can now move while attacking
- Inmate #43B now takes 6 seconds to reach maximum damage, up from 5
- Inmate #43B now takes 2 seconds to reach minimum damage, down from 2.5

> Inmate #43B has undergone a pretty hefty change. If you hold down RALLY while controlling a Badger, she will continue to fire while moving, unlike any other unit in the game. Use this to great effect to keep her dishing out maximum damage.

- Uncle Butter is now 7 ATK, down from 8
- Uncle Butter can no longer move while attacking

- The Glorious AFB's basic attack is now 1 ATK, down from 2
- Winged Demons now have 8 bullets per clip, instead of 12, but still fire over 2 seconds.
- Cobblestone movement speed is now 1.3, down from 1.4

**Area of Effect Damage**

- All AOE now does 100% of its damage to its primary target, and 25% of its damage to all other targets in its AOE

This will be the last balance patch before the Clash of Comrades: July Joust. The last tournament was a blast and I can't wait to see what happens this time around.
