Thank you BICFest for choosing Tooth and Tail to be a part of your Official Selection of Indie Games for 2016.

As a result, we will be flying out to South Korea and showing off Tooth and Tail.

This is very exciting because Tooth and Tail's design is very inspired by Starcraft and it's competitive history. We hope that the attendeees of BICFest see the amount of Starcraft love we have put into the game!
