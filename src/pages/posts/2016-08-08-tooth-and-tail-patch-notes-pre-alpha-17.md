#Pre-Alpha 17

This week's patch includes a bunch of quality of life changes, as well as a few changes to balance. A lot of the community has agreed that the game is in the best state of balance right now, so the tweaks will be minor, but should make a big improvement of the game.

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.pocketwatchgames.com/chat.html).

##Gameplay

**Balance**

- The Tooth Collector's poison will now affect structures!

> This change was brought about to give more options on how to deal with structures other than ferrets. The Tooth Collector's do not have the range to keep them out of danger so use this poison wisely!

- Featherwire is now 15 DEF, down from 25
- Featherwire now does 2 ATK, up from 1

> Featherwire is difficult to balance because only a few units can interact with it. The units that can attack it, also receive damage from it, so in a way, the Featherwire protects itself from it's own weakness. This change is to prevent the scenario in which there are tons of wire on the battlefield, causing the game to slow down as enemies have to slowly widdle away at them.

- Bullet Hives now have 35 DEF, down from 40.
- Bullet Hive fire rate is now .1 seconds, instead of .2 seconds

> With that much DEF, the Bullet Hive was able to shut down an entire attack witha single structure. Given that it builds so quickly and is so versatile, I think it was due for a slight nerf, despite not being OP.

> This is simply a character change that will have little to no impact on actual balance. THe Bullet Hive is a machine gun which is supposed to shoot faster than anything in the game.

- Falcons now fire every second, rather than burst for 2 seconds with a 2 second cooldown'

> This is a quality of life change based on player feedback. The Falcons used to require a reload after they ran out of bullets. This meant that some times, the Falcon could be on a low ammo clip and engage in shorter combat than expected. The Falcons attack more quickly now, so this instance will be minimized.

- An improvement has been made to units that reload

> There are two units that reload, the Winged Demons and the Drumfire Cannon. These units have a clip of some ammo amount, and previously they reloaded whenever they ran out of ammo. This created an issue where you could be sitting on their last bullet forcing an early reload and causing the next engagement to be a lot weaker than expected. Now, reload will occur immediately after firing.

- Increased Tremormine time till detonate to .75 seconds, up from .5 seconds

- The Wretches will now follow your Commanders rally

- The Volunteers now have 10 DEF, up from 5

- Gristmills now have 100 DEF, down from 120

> This is largely intended to speed up the end of the game where players have to kill multiple bases, but let us know if this breaks the game's balance.

**Exclusive Territory**

This is a brand new feature that was implemented to solve some aggressive turret rushes that wasn't sitting well with us. Territory works the same way it did before, except now territory will exclusively belong to the Commander who has the closer Gristmill.

It additionally will help clean up the visuals of what territory belongs to you.

##UI

- The Options Screen has been improved, but is still far from finalized
- Yellow squares will now be used to denote "Queuing Farms" rather than Green squares
- Territory lines are now darker and easier to see

## Art

- Archimedes is now yellow (again)!
- The Wretches no longer do a flip every time they attack
- Water rings now appear at the characters waist rather than at their midpoint
- Visual improvements were made to Thermal Airsniper and Drumfire Cannon
- Shrubs on cliffs are now darker
- Improvements were made to the healing particle effects

##Performance

- Moles and Pigs will now retain the amount of HP they have when they emerge from the ground, rather than resetting to 100% HP

> This was always a bug. It now means building Moles and Pigs during combat is even more dangerous.

- Fixed a bug that caused large amounts of melee units to not attack
- You will no longer be able to hear if the enemy has built a Gristmill outside of your vision
- Structures and Pigs can now focus fire!
- Replays are now about 1/4 the file size. Average replay file size was 15 MB. New replay file size is now 4 MB.
- Improvements to the AI of the Wretches
