#Pre-Alpha 19

We have been relatively silent on development of Tooth and Tail lately, but it has all been for good reason. Today we are proud to announce the unveiling of two major features that have been in development for the last couple months. Arena Mode and AI Bots are now available to test! Please give us your feedback in Discord.

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.pocketwatchgames.com/chat.html).

##New Features

[![Bots](http://i.imgur.com/GRdh15M.png "Bots")](http://i.imgur.com/GRdh15M.png)

**Bots**

Practice against AI or play with a friend against 2 AI. You can even set 4 AI to play 4P FFA and observe them fight! I look forward to AI battle gambling matches. The Bot system is intended to become a fully fledged feature, so there are many more details that I would like to reveal at a later date.

This is the first attempt at AI in the game, so please report any bugs in Discord.

**Arena Mode**

Arena Mode is the Official Competitive Mode for Tooth and Tail. Arena mode is now unlocked in the Alpha for all to test.

Upon entering Arena mode you will be paired against another first time Arena player. If you win, you will start a win streak, if you lose, your streak will be set to the previous checkpoint.

There are several checkpoints in the Arena system.

**Wins : Rank**

- 0 : Pigeon
- 1 : Squirrel
- 2 : Lizard
- 3 : Skunk
- 5 : Ferret
- 7 : Falcon
- 10 : Fox
- 15 : Wolf

The game will attempt to pair you against other players with a similar rank within a reasonable time limit before it expands its search.

This is the first pass at Arena mode and it is very difficult to test without a lot of activity, so expect tons of bugs. Please give us your feedback in our Discord channel.
