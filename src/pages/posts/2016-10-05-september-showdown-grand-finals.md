Congrats to Deadbones for claiming their first Clash of Comrades title! HUGE props to everyone involved in the tournament. Especially those working behind the scenes, like Mj0331, Freakspot, Brotenko, and Mastastealth, to ensure the technical aspects of the streams went smoothly and coding last minute.

Data from the tournament will be used to help balance the game even further. We look forward to the next tournament in November!
