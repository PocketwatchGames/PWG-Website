[AVUltima](https://www.youtube.com/user/AVUltima) has been with the community since he first got hooked on Tooth and Tail at PAX East 2016. Shortly after, AVUltima quickly rose to the top, immediately becoming one of the best players in the community. He secured his title when he became the first to defeat ZenoAkoop in a Clash of Comrades tournament in a very unpredictable [Grand Finals set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgBf-Sk033Q&list=PLZbbOqfA4KdTzOGlFniYLDZhkXGnHoWu7).

Since then, he's produced a number of helpful tutorial videos which you can watch here.

These videos give newer players just a taste of the potential of high level play. I look forward to many more videos, as AVUltima's voice sounds like butter in my ears.

Here's what AVUltima has to say:

> "Whether it's game design or video editing, I have to feel inspired. Tooth and Tail is a game I greatly enjoy, so it's natural for me to create content for it. It isn't for the views, or because it's the next big thing. It's because it's freakin' awesome. Otherwise, I wouldn't do it." -AVUltima
