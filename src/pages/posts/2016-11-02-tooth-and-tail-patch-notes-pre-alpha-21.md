#Pre-Alpha 21

This patch marks the reveal of a large number of quality of life changes. Many of these will require tweaking, so please provide us with any feedback you might have on them.

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our Discord chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.discord.gg/Pocketwatch).

##New Features

**Improved Commander Movement**

There will no longer be any input lag when moving the Commander online. This will result in more immediate Commander movement.

**Custom Keybindings**

You can now customize your own keyboard controls.

**Improved Keyboard Controls**

Moving at a diagonal angle will now cause your Commander to move diagonally in game space, rather than in 45 degree screen space. This makes it much easier to walk alongside cliffs, bridges, and cut tight corners.

**Improved Building Placement**

You will now build structures centered around the Commander rather than building from the northern most tile of the building.

Additionally, the game will now attempt to build structures in a nearby location if you attempt to build in an area that would normally fail.

**Improved Minimap Colors**

The yellow of Archimedes was very hard to read against the terrain in the minimap. so we have brightened it to make it more visible. All other Commanders have received tweaks as well.

**Balance**

- Engineers for Hire no longer do 2x damage to structures
- Engineers for Hire now have 3 ATK, up from 2
- Winged Demons now have 6 ATK, up from 5
- Thermal Airsnipers now have 30 DEF, down from 40
- Uncle Butter now has 100 DEF, down from 120

**Targeting**

- Previous, Warrens had to be targeted first before any units standing on top of it. Now, players can target units before Warrens if their targeting reticle is closer to the Unit than to the center of the Warren.

**Uncle Butter**

- Uncle Butter has been completely redesigned.

> We were never happy with the poor readability of his previous AOE attack. The fire particle effect was never an accurate indication of what units were in and out of the AOE, so we have redesigned Butter.

> Butter is still a T3 AOE unit who deals great damage to large numbers of units.

Butter will now target an area up to 4 tiles in front of him, and ignite 10 tiles in that area. This attack will stream continuously.

[![Uncle Butter](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKS9TCC9Gn5RdVS/source.gif "Uncle Butter")](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKS9TCC9Gn5RdVS/source.gif)

Butter's fire effect occupies the same space as the Skunk gas, so both attacks will never occupy the same tile at once. If a tile is already occupied by an AOE, the flames or gas will fill the next nearest tile.

**Pigeon**

- Pigeons will now heal at melee range
- Pigeon heals can now stack

> This makes it easier to counter Pigeons with range, but harder to brute force attack through their healing output.

**Artillery**

- Artillery is now at 40 second build time to match other Tier 3
