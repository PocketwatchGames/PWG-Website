#Pre-Alpha 22

This patch will reveal some BIG features we could not wait to deliver. First we have two Unit Reworks, which may require immediate rebalancing, so please help us. Second, we have implemented the first Unit Voice Over. The frequency and volume of these SFX will still be tuned, so your feedback is most wanted!

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our Discord chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.discord.gg/Pocketwatch).

##Gameplay

- Tier 3 structures will now cost 180 food for the Structure and 180 food for the Unit, rather than 240 for the Structure and 120 for the Unit

> This change attempts to reduce the risk of building T3 in battle. It is currently very hard to save up 240 at the high level, so we hope this will let some players get their T3 out sooner, without changing the overall cost of the unit.

- You can no longer burrow through bridges
- Updated descriptions for multiple units to accurately reflect new changes

- Drumfire Cannon's build cost has been reduced to 180 to reflect Tier 3 changes

**Observer**

- You can no longer move the camera beyond the bounds of the map world

- Nomads of the North
