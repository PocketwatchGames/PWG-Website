After huge demand from his fans, Ohmwrecker just followed up with another episode of Tooth and Tail.

Here's what he has to say:

> So I've got to admit you guys really surprised me with all the love for Tooth & Tail episode 1! I love playing games like these, and it sounds like you guys loved watching it too. In this episode I give Satt a chance to finally take me down, I'm really rooting for him too! No worries, he promises me he's going to keep practicing so he may finally dethrone me. -Ohmwrecker / Maskedgamer
