General concensus is that the game is in the most balanced state it has ever been, but there's still a lot of data to gather from these tournaments. Keep your eyes peeled for the next tournament which is a 2v2 team tournament!

The next tournament is [Faction Frenzy 3](http://www.clashofcomrades.com/tournaments/view?id=6), starting on Dec 17/18 2PM EST
