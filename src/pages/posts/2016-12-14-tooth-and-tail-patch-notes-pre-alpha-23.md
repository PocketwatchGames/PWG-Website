#Pre-Alpha 23

Patch 23 will feature mostly changes based on what we observed from the most recent tournament, November Knockout. It also features a lot of optimizations, so if your computer has been running Tooth and Tail slowly, now will be the best time to play!

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our Discord chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.discord.gg/Pocketwatch).

##New Features##

**Updated Graphs**

- All other graphs removed

##Gameplay

- Drumfire Cannons now have a 1 second bullet travel time, down from 1.5

> This change was made to make the Drumfire Cannon feel more effective. It will now miss less often, but it's overall stats are the same.

- Chameleons now attacks 2 times per second, up from 1
- Chameleons can now restealth from an attack after .5 seconds, down from 2

> The Trench Gang was the most unused unit in the entire November Tournament, with a 0% pick rate in Top 8. While I think the stats on him were generally good, I think he needed much more verstility in terms of general usage. This change is mostly a quality of life change, but expect to see the Trench Gang played in a more general style, as well as his original sneak attack play.
