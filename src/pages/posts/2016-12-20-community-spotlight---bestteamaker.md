[BestTeaMaker](https://twitch.tv/BestTeaMaker) has been with the community since August and has quickly become one of the most prominent casters in our community. His passion for the game came from the eSports scene of which he has had a strong background casting other game. Our most memorable moment of BestTeaMaker was when he came down to San Diego for TwitchCon after winning a community competition.

Here's an example of one of his most exciting casts.

BestTeaMaker even compiled a data driven analysis of the recent November Knockout tournament, which yields some interesting information on unit pick rates and tier popularity.

This data has directly influenced current balance patches, and I hope to continue to use community contributions like this as part of my set of tools to help make Tooth and Tail the best it can possibly be.

Here's what BestTeaMaker has to say:

> "I feel like Tooth and Tail has the potential to take the world by storm. It's exciting to see a unique take on the RTS genre work so well and play fantastically. But above all, I think it's amazing that the developers have opened up this game to the community, and I feel honored to be among those who watch and help this game grow so much." -BestTeaMaker
