#Pre-Alpha 23.02 Hotfix

##Gameplay

One of the most consistent feedback we have received was on the pace of Squirrel combat. Squirrels being 3/5 meant that most combat was resolved in 2 seconds, with only 2 volleys of bullets deciding who would be the victor. Because of this, the initial engagement meant so much in a Squirrel composition.

To slow down the pace of combat, while still retaining overall balance, we have made the following balance adjustmnets:

- Squirrels are now 2/8, changed from 3/5
- Toads are now 8 DEF

##Performance

- A graphics memory optimization was made to improve performance
- Replays are now fixed
- Voice over for Mice have been fixed
- Snakes will now properly do 20 damage, instead of 19.99
