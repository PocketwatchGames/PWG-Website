#2016 was an incredible year for Tooth and Tail

##GDC:The MIX - San Francisco, California
We started the year with an invite to the MIX at the Game Developers Conference. This marked one of the first times showing the game directly to press and we had great positive response. We even won the Audience Award! Thank you :)

##PAX East - Boston, Massachusetts

We next traveled to the Penny Arcade Expo in Boston and it turned out to be one of our most beloved PAX events. We introduced Tooth and Tail to some of our most cherished community members for the first time, such as AVUltima, Gaming Mistress and Mozzarella Sticks. In addition, CaptnFog, who runs the Tooth and Tail tournament scene, dropped by to help with the booth the entire weekend. What a joy!

##E3: The MIX - Los Angeles, California

We were once again invited to the MIX, but this time at Electronic Entertainment Expo. This was another beautiful show from the MIX and we were surrounded by so many great games. We were honored to bring home the runner-up Audience Award as well.

##PAX West - Seattle, Washington

We returned to PAX West first time in 2 years. This time however, we were invited to demo the game at the Intel Booth for having won the Intel Level-up for Best Character Design. Huge congrats to everyone on the team for making such amazing characters!

##BICFest - Busan, South Korea

We quickly traveled afterwards to the Busan Indie Connect Festival. This event was one of the most memorable moments in my career. One of my favorite Monaco fan artists traveled 2 hours by train to visit us. Her name is Coramin, and her art can be found [here](http://coraminother.tumblr.com/).

Additionally, as I was struggling to communicate how to play Tooth and Tail to non-English speakers, out of nowhere, community member readingsnail appeared. He traveled 90 minutes to come aide us at the booth and translate the game into Korean. He was a real life saver. It was unplanned for and felt like a miracle.

##MineCon - Anaheim, California

We were invited to Minecon shortly after to demo the game among a select group of other indie developers. Minecon was a wonderful unique venue for us because the majority of players here were very young. It was amazing seeing these kids' eyes light up while playing Tooth and Tail, just like mine did when I was young.

#TwitchCon - San Diego, California

We were really pleased to find out that in 2016, Twitch would hold their second annual convention in our home town of San Diego. TwitchCon was a sleeper hit for us. The show had so much attendance and the fans were incredibly passionate. I hope they return next year.

#PSX - Anaheim, California

We announced this year that we would simultaneously launch on Playstation 4 as well as PC. With the announcement of our console version, we were invited to Sony's third annual Playstation Experience. I can't believe how many cool games there were!
