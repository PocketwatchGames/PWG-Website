**Hotkeys for Controller**

We've added the ability to bind Y to select any unit in your army. Simply hold the corresponding button down on the unit you want to bind and it will become a new hotkey.

##Gameplay

**Balance**

> The following balance was based on consistent user feedback about how Tier 1 has become too much of a dominant force. We've tuned T2 to incentivize more mid-game and late-game transitions. Please discuss in #balancing any opinions you might have if some of these were overtuned.

- Pigeons now heal at 1 heal per second, down from 2
- Toad now detonate after .25 seconds, down from .50
- Lizards are now 8 DEF, down from 10
- Moles are now 24 DEF, up from 20
- Mice are now 12 DEF, down from 15
- Ferrets are now 20 DEF, up from 15
- Skunk gas now lasts 20 seconds, up from 15
- Badger is now 70 DEF, up from 60

**Observer**

- The observer camera will now move at half speed
- There are new controls for observer mode for speeding up the match and navigating graphs
- Match timer for observers is now in the bottom left
- Replay file names can now have spaces and other special characters

##UI

- Enable Cheats is now in the options menu, this won't work for online games
- New indicator for when you queue a farm
- In progress matches will show their current place in time
- Main menu buttons will now animate when you mouse over them
