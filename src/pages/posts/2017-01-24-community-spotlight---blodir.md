[Blodir](www.twitch.com/blodir) is a new addition to the community, but in that short time has proved to be an incredible force. When Blodir isn't dominating his matches, he's composing for his [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/pyry-m-kinen/). With Austin Wintory's eclectic soundtrack for Tooth and Tail, Blodir couldn't resist making his own musical interpretation.

Blodir's song "Rat March" is the first Tooth and Tail fan music.

Here's what Blodir has to say:

> "Pocketwatch games has succeeded in doing what many other developers have failed; creating an RTS that is approachable to the casual player, yet remaining engaging for the experienced player. The visual aesthetic is as unique as it is awesome and Austin Wintory's soundtrack matches the visuals spot on, painting a somber mood to the war torn world. Who knew cartoon animals could be so serious!

> Tooth and Tail has all the right ingredients and the right people to make it a tremendous indie title." -Blodir
