#Pre-Alpha 25

Patch 25 features a newly remodeled lobby and warren system! We are incredibly excited for this change and would love to hear your feedback on it. In addition, January was a month of fierce competition, which brought to light many necessary changes to the games balance.

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our Discord chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.discord.gg/Pocketwatch).

##Gameplay

**Balance**

> Despite the most recent patch featuring a slew of buffs to Tier 2, we still found ourselves in an extremely dominant Tier 1 meta. As a result, the only viable solution was to either counter with Tier 1 as well or rush straight to Tier 3. The follow changes are an attempt to make Tier 2 more relevant, while lowering the dominance of a Tier 3 rush.

**Tier 1**

- Lizards are now 9 DEF, up from 8
- Moles are now 25 DEF, up from 24
- Toads are now 6 DEF, down from 8

**Tier 2**

- Skunks are now 35 DEF, up from 30
- Skunks now attack once per second, rather than once per two seconds
- Skunk gas now lasts 10 seconds, down from 20

> These changes will result in a similar amount of maximum gas spread, however it will improve the fart and run gameplay of the Skunk. Previously, Skunks took so long to fire that they often died before doing any significant damage.

- Ferrets are now 25 DEF, up from 20
- Ferrets can now hit up to 2 targets, up from 1

> If there are 2 targets in a single tile, both targets will now take damage. The most common scenario for this is if a unit is standing on a warren. Previously, only the unit would take damage.

- Falcons are now 25 DEF, up from 20
- Snakes are now 35 DEF, up from 30

**Tier 3**

- Badger is now 60 DEF, down from 70
- Boar is now 3 ATK, down from 4
- Fox is now 35 DEF, down from 40
- Wolf can now buff 6 units, up from 4

**Ranged Combat**

> We are making a pretty substantial change to ranged combat. We recently noticed that ranged units were not properly halting when firing, resulting in the ability to move and shoot. In the right hands, a player could attack and chase an enemy forever, which severely hurts the tactics of retreat. We've addressed all units that exhibit this behavior and the following changes have been made.

The following units will now stop moving for .25 seconds upon firing their weapon:

- Squirrel
- Ferret
- Skunk
- Snake
- Pigs
- Fox

##UI

- Default Deck is now Randomize Deck and will ......randomize your deck.
- You can now add bots to lobbies via a single button
- You can now switch to observer or player via a single button
- Removed Net Worth graph
- Observer minimap now reflects the visibility you currently have toggled
- New warren descriptions for Ferret and Owl
- Farms that have been killed will have an exclamation point and will no longer look red
- Updated button hint art to support keyboards

---

##Performance

- Added VSync options
- Reduced the amount of maximum screen shake
- Fixed an issue causing Badgers to sometimes crash the game
- Fixed an issue that caused some lobbies to be unable to proceed when both players are ready
