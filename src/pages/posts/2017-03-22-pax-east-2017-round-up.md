This year's PAX East was by far the biggest and best event Pocketwatch has ever done! We had our biggest booth ever and if it weren't for a miracle, we would have been overwhelmed!

Those of you who remember last year know that a community member CaptnFog came by to help us run the booth. This year, we were supported by not 1, but 12 community members.

Our booth was the busiest we had ever seen it, but thanks to the help of our community, we were able to keep the stations alive!

Here's some fun highlights of the show.

We also got a bunch of shout-outs from press as well!
