Today we will be spotlighting **CalixJumi**, who happens to be one of the longest running members of our community! CalixJumi joined us back in the IRC days before we even had a Mac version of the game available. Despite that, he waited for over a year to play, checking the stream out every week. Since then, he's become our most prominent contributor to Mac bug reporting.

CalixJumi recently went above and beyond when he drove to Austin, Texas from Mexico to showcase Tooth and Tail at South by Southwest. SXSW is a festival that showcases musics, film, and video games, and Tooth and Tail was nominated for their Multiplayer Showcase.

Pocketwatch was not able to attend this event due to schedule conflicts with PAX East, but CalixJumi quickly stepped in to help us out when we needed him most!

Here's some pictures he took from the event.

Here's what he has to say:

> Well&hellip; a lot of fun stuff happened!
> "Running a booth has to be so much fun." That was me after watching pictures of PAX South and people preparing for PAX East. It is lots of fun indeed, meeting people all day and having fun and stuff. However, I felt like an impostor at first, everyone was so awesome and it isn't impostor syndrome if it's true.
> "But you are a game dev Calix even if you haven&rsquo;t released anything!"
> D'aww thank you reader!, but when I'm in an interview and someone asks me
> "What's the idea behind YOUR game?" just after telling them I was just a representative of PWG... (I'll watch my reaction to that later). At some point I just accepted that feeling.
> I&rsquo;m not sure if I can make a comparison on the size of the event, it felt chill and not crowded at any moment, although we were in the very (very literal) indie corner of the expo, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure all the attendees had a great time, specially playing TnT :D. My favorite players were families playing with their kids or brothers playing against each other, because they had the most fun out of the game. In retrospect, maybe the booth attracted more of them because of the Mexican candies [CalixJumi Booth Pro Tips TM]. There was a guy who just stole a bunch like if I wasn&rsquo;t watching&hellip; BUT I WAS, AND I WILL FIND YOU AND MAKE YOU PLAY TNT.
> The whole trip was amazing! Can't thank PWG enough for inviting me, and thanks to @fawkes32 for helping me through the weekend.
