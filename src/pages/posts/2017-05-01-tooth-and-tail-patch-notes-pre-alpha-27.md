#Pre-Alpha 27

Patch 27 features Arena, a brand new way to play Tooth and Tail online! Everyone has been asking us for a ranked competitive mode for Tooth and Tail, and we're super excited to finally be bringing this to the feasting table! We're asking all testers (even those in retirement) to help stress test this new system all day today, as Arena works best when many people are playing simultaneously!

This latest patch is now live to all Alpha testers. If you want to participate in the Tooth and Tail Alpha, please jump into our Discord chatroom and talk directly with us [HERE](http://www.discord.gg/Pocketwatch).

##Arena

**1. Tiers**

Arena is a win-streak based matchmaking system for 1v1 online games. After winning your first match, you will earn a star at your current tier. Your current tier is represented by a propaganda poster depicting your heroic efforts to feed the people! The title of each tier, along with the number of wins required to reach that tier are listed below:

- Malcontent
  - Win Streak Required: 0
  - Wins to Advance: 1
- Agitator
  - Win Streak Required: 1
  - Wins to Advance: 1
- Rabble Rouser
  - Win Streak Required: 2
  - Wins to Advance: 1
- Militant
  - Win Streak Required: 3
  - Wins to Advance: 2
- Firebrand
  - Win Streak Required: 5
  - Wins to Advance: 2
- Hero of the Hungry
  - Win Streak Required: 7
  - Wins to Advance: 3
- The Great Provider
  - Win Streak Required: 10
  - Wins to Advance: 5
- Fury of the Feast
  - Win Streak Required: 15

The first three tiers (Malcontent, Agitator, and Rabble Rouser) all require only one win to advance to the next tier. Your progress towards ranking up is represented by stars on your poster. When you've earned all your stars by winning enough games in a row, you'll move up to the next tier.

Tiers act as streak savers, or checkpoints, in the event of a loss. At any tier, if you lose one match you will lose all of your stars. If you have no stars and lose, you will fall back to the previous tier. Here's an example:

> I have a win streak of 6, which makes me a Firebrand with one star. If I lose a match, I will lose that star and fall back to a streak of 5. If a lose again, my streak will drop to 3, and I'll be demoted to Militant.

**2. Matchmaking**

We try really hard to match you with players who are near your tier. Every few seconds we will expand your search to include players who may be in a higher or lower tier than you. You will only be matched with players whose current tier is within your tier _plus or minus_ your search tolerance. Your search tolerance increases every few seconds, and can be seen in the status window beneath your current poster.

**3. The Arena Lobby**

The interface we are all accustomed to from custom lobbies is back in Arena, with only a few minor tweaks:

- You have 15 seconds to choose a commander
- You have 45 seconds to choose a deck

If you run out of time while choosing a commander, the commander you are highlighting will be auto-locked. If there is a conflict, the lobby will decide for you. There is no time to lose! The timer in deck selection works similarly. If your deck is incomplete at the end of the 45 second period, the empty slots in your deck are randomly filled.

The following features are also disabled in Arena:

- Adding local players and bots
- Switch to Observer (additionally, Arena matches are not observable from the lobby list)
- Match Options (e.g. custom seeds, map type, etc.)

**4. Leaderboards**

The following leaderboards are now available:

- Hourly Standings: see who currently has the highest win streak, resets every hour
- Weekly Best: see who had the best win streak this week
- All Time: see who had the greatest music video of all time

##Gameplay

- Badger now has 50 DEF, down from 60
- Boar now has 4 ATK, up from 3
- Boar now has 120 HP, up from 100

- Skunks now fire once per second, up from once every 2 seconds
- Ferret shots will no longer be capped at 2 maximum targets

##UI

- All-new animations for ranking up/down in Arena!
- Replays screen is a lot wider now.
- Many UI animations are much smoother now as a result of fixing a bug.
