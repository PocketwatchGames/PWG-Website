##Gameplay

**Balance**

Balance changes are based on the popularity of certain units over others in competitive play. While we are incredibly happy with the variety of units picked, there are still some that are picked more often than others.

- Skunk is now 3 ATK, down from 4
- Toad is now 7 DEF, up from 6
- Vision range added to flying units is now 2, down from 4
- The bonus single target damage for landmines have been removed
- The bonus single target damage for artillery has been removed

**AOE**

AOE units are getting a massive change in order to help us better improve AOE gameplay. We have a unique challenge of balancing AOE in a game where units mostly stay together.

- Landmines will no longer do bonus damage to the unit that triggered them
- Artillery will no longer do bonus damage to units in the center of the impact
- Artillery is now 4 damage, down from 8
- Toads will now do 18 damage to main target and 3 damage to all AOE targets

**Pigeons**

- Pigeon range is now 2, up from 1
- Pigeons can now heal while moving
- Pigeons will now stay at maximum range while healing
- Pigeon heals now travel at .25 seconds, down from .5

**Wolf**

- Wolf now buffs unit production, but not building speed
- Wolf buff now lasts 8 seconds, down from 12
- Wolf can now only buff 4 units at once, down from 6

**Map Generation**

- Lakes and rivers have now been improved to look more natural and which results in a wider variety of water

- AI has been improved to be more aggressive, and will be quicker to spend resources rather than saving them
