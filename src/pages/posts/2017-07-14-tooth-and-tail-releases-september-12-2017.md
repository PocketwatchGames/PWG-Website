Tooth and Tail launches on Steam, PS4, and GOG on September 12, 2017!

Additionally, pre-orders will be available on all platforms this Tuesday, July 18th!

- [Wishlist on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/286000) so you can be reminded when the preorder goes live
- [DRM-Free build](https://www.gog.com/news/coming_soon_tooth_and_tail) will be available on GOG
- [Full PS4 announcement](https://blog.us.playstation.com/) on the Playstation Blog (with Single Player screenshots)

The long wait is finally coming to a close. We started work on Tooth and Tail in January of 2014, and now, three and a half years later, we're excited to finally announce our release date. We've got the Cinematic Trailer hot off the presses too (which is the intro to the Single Player campaign).

And just a taste, folks, that's what you're gonna get of the single player stuff here:

Anyways, we're super proud to be finally finishing up. But don't worry, this will just be the first chapter. We've got more announcements to come soon, and we will be heavily supporting the game with additional content once it's out!
