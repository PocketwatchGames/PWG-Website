##Other Questions:

**Q:** _Do I get anything with the pre-order?_

**A:** You mean, aside from the discount? We're working on some stuff, but we don't have anything set in stone and ready to announce. No promises, okay?

**Q:** _A 2-month pre-order? Why so long?_

**A:** Wanna hear a secret? Come a little closer. OK, here it is. We were slated to launch on August 15th, and then a little company called Blizzard announced that Starcraft Remastered was launching on August 14th. We didn't want to destroy Blizzard too badly, so we decided to give them a little breathing room. Gotta look out for the little guy, ya know?

**Q:** _I'm so excited to play!_

**A:** Me too. Me too.
