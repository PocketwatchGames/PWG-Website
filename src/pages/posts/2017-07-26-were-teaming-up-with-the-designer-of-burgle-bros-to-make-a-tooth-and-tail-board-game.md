After Monaco came out in 2013, a friend of ours approached us about turning Monaco into a board game. While it was an interesting thought, we at Pocketwatch were perhaps a bit too protective about the world of Monaco, so we ended up passing on the opportunity. That friend’s name was Tim Fowers, and he ended up designing the game anyways. [Burgle Bros](http://www.burglebros.com/), a cooperative heist board game, is now listed as one of the top 300 games of all time on [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172081/burgle-bros).

We’re not passing on the chance this time: Tim is currently honing a real-time-strategy-inspired board game, based on the world and characters of Tooth and Tail!

It's still too early to share game details or a release date. But for those of you who follow Tim’s games, you know that a Tooth and Tail board game is bound to be great. Tim is well known for having full control over his games’ production, as well as his complex takes on simple designs. If that sounds similar to Pocketwatch Games, well, it’s no surprise that we eventually found a way to work together!
