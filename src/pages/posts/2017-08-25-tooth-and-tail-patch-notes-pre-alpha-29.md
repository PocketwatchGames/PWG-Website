##Ranked

> When we first introduced Arena, one of our biggest complaints was how stressful it felt to lose multiple stars after a single game. Originally, there were only several checkpoints in the ranking system. We've increased those number of checkpoints to 40 and so the matchmaking is more similar to a traditional Ranked system. If you win, you will earn a star, if you lose, you will lose a star. And as always, you will be matched with players closest to your rank.

**End Game**

> A new feature to our Ranked mode is the new end game system. Upon achieving the highest rank, you will compete with others at the top rank in a King of the Hill mode. This mode is most similar to our original system, where you try to see how many wins you can achieve before you lose. The highest scores will stay on the leaderboards.

##Gameplay

**Balance**

- Ferrets can now only hit up to 2 targets with a single shot, instead of being completely AOE
- Ferrets and Artillery have had their vision increased to 5, up from 4

> The vision range increase was based on new user feedback where there was consistent confusion on why Ferrets would walk into the turrets they were shooting.

**Focus Fire Range**

- Focus Fire Range has been reduced to 1 tile, down from 2

> We believe that this will improve the precision desired for focus firing. Additionally, we often see new players struggle with retreating, and this will greatly help their ability to do so.
