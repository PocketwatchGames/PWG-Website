## **What is Tooth and Tail?**

The animals of Tooth and Tail are at war over who gets to eat, and who must be dinner. From the creators of Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine comes a similarly fast, distilled, darkly humorous take on the Real-Time Strategy genre.

Unlike other RTS games, you interact with the world entirely through your army's Flagbearer. Success or failure rests not on the speed of your reflexes or studying the perfect build order -- you will win based on your ability to outwit and improvise.

We've been running a private beta for a few years now, here's the shoutcasted finals from one of our recent fan-run tournaments:
