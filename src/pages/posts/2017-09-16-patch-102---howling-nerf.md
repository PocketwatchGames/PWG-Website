![Patch 1.0.2](https://i.imgur.com/Mal3D6I.jpg)

Patch 1.02 is live - We've fixed a bunch of problems pertaining to multiplayer and sanded down some of the mission difficulty. Hopper's campaign is less brutal across the board, and a couple of her heroics are made a touch easier. Howling Vell is significantly nerfed.

#Multiplayer#

- Ranked Matchmaking searches with "far" filter to solve people not finding matches
- Fixed Ranked Cheating problems: Increased redplug timeout (which results in a draw) to be longer than the Steam lobby timeout (which results in a loss). Players should timeout of their lobbies first. Increased to 30 seconds rather than 9 seconds.
- Ranked - Reduced queue times for higher tolerances: Changed to 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 from 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90

#Story Mode#

- Snikaree Liberation - Removed time requirement on Heroic
- The Sand Kiln at Levacaloo - Removed time requirement on Heroic
- Scrapetown Cutpurse Changes - Removed skunk patrollers, Revised mission hint
- The Hungry Face a Stiff Wind - Removed 2 artillery cannons, several machine gun turrets, and 25% of the barbed wire.
- Howling Vell - Reduced enemy mills from 3 to 2, Spaced out mills better to prevent enemy pigs from spawning in range of player pigs

#Bug Fixes#

- Added option to disable video (for people that crash on video playback)
- Fixed problem where game would crash on start because it couldn't load the audio - now it just disables audio :-/ If you are experiencing this bug, you may need to update your drivers for one of your external devices, like headphones.

#GOG Galaxy#

- Ranked Matchmaking now connects consistently
