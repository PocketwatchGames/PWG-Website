![Patch 1.0.3](https://i.imgur.com/JiI8sdD.jpg)

Good news and bad news for you snipers out there: Kasha's getting nerfed... but Thermal Airsnipers (balloons) are going beast mode. Patch 1.0.3 is out!

#Online#

- GOG Crossplay - At long last, GOG and Steam players can now play together!
- Ranked Matchmaking searches with "worldwide" filter to solve people not finding matches
- Added a player list to the post match screen
- Passworded lobbies - When you create an Unranked lobby, you can optionally enter a password. This lobby will only show up for users that search with that password.
- Friend Invites temporarily disabled to support crossplay (we hope to re-enable invites next patch). For now, use passworded lobbies.
