It's true, we fixed all bugs, ever. Here's the list of those bugs. And to celebrate having fixed all bugs, ever, here's some wallpaper we made for promo art that we never ended up using. Enjoy!

- Users that couldn't play online due to "Please log in to steam to play online" can now play online. (it was all you silly folks with symbols in your steam name)
- Top scores on the leaderboard are no longer missing or blank
- Improved lag handling that was introduced in cross-play patch.
