title: "Hotfix 1.0.4.4: Now with Nerfs!"
---

Given that 1.0.4.0 was a controversial patch with some big new features, it's not surprising that we'd need to hotfix some bugs and fix some imbalance. Here's all the stuff we've fixed since the Butterbomb arrived!

- Badger Windup wasn't completing all the way. Fixed. Also reduced her max DMG to 20 (from 30).
- Boar DMG was listed at 3 dps but was actually 4. It is now actually 3. Also, the flame coverage was reduced from 10 tiles to 8 tiles.
- Fox cast time and movement freeze was supposed to total 0.75 seconds, but actually only froze for 0.6 seconds. This is fixed, and may affect other units with a movement cooldown as well (squirrel, etc)
- Warren health was listed as 50/75/100 but was still 60/60/60. Fixed.
- Roads in Monastic Gardens now give speed buff
- Lobby creation crash on mac fixed
- Ranked match auto-disconnect fixed
