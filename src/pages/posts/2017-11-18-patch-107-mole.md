![The Mole Patch](https://i.imgur.com/9yH0VXV.jpg)

For those not fluent in Simplified Chinese or Korean, that reads MOLE MOLE MOLE, which is the major change this patch.

##Languages##
Two new languages were adding to the game this patch! You can now play the entire game in:

- Korean!
- Simplified Chinese!

##Gameplay##

- Focus firing units on top of warrens is much easier now
- Melee units surround enemies much better
- Toads no longer derp out on their way to their targets
- Ranked matchmaking now goes through the entire search once with the "Far" filter, and then if no matches are found, it runs through it again with the "Worldwide" filter. This will result in longer queue times but fewer bad connections, which was necessary as we expect an influx of Chinese and Korean players.

##Balance Changes##

- Lizard - 2 Range, 8 HP (from 1 Range, 11 HP). No longer hit barbed wire. Yes, I finally relented. Everyone's favorite range 2 lizard is back. FML
- Mole - The headliner of the event. They are now 15 HP, 4 DMG + x2 DMG to structures (from 25 HP, 2 DMG, no crit). This makes them less effective at killing early game pigs and far less effective as mid-game tanks, but they are now a constant threat vs your structures. Players can sell off their structures and invest in moles at a moment's notice and push in on your stuff. They will go from being an early game threat to being an ALL game threat!
- Toad - Dmg reduced to 8+2AOE (from 9+3AOE)
- Pigeon - They were listed as healing 2 HP per second, but were only healing 1 per second. This is fixed. They now heal 2 per second.
- Chameleon - 35 HP from 40 HP
- Snake - Last week I accidentally nerfed them to 30 HP, they are back to their intended 35 HP.
