Season 2 has arrived, and with it a revamp of Ranked matchmaking!

##Ladder Reset##
Season 2 uses a different model for determining player skill, so we're resetting the ladder. Come scramble your way back up again!

##Player Stats##
You can now see your pick rate and win rate for each unit on the Ranked screen by clicking the Stats button. You can also see community-wide pick and win rates. If everyone is going squirrel, follow the meta or play counter meta!

##MMR##
You will now gain/lose different amounts of points based on the difference in rank between you and your opponent.

Earn 100 points to advance a tier. While "Fury of the Feast" is still the top tier, every 100 points will advance you another master rank. If you beat someone 6 ranks below you, you will gain a point and they will lose a point. If you beat someone 6 ranks or more above you you will gain 100 points and they will lose 100 points.

Point change for each tier differential are as follows:

- -6 or more: 1 point
- -5: 2 points
- -4: 3 points
- -3: 4 points
- -2: 5 points
- -1: 10 points
- Equal Rank: 20 points
- +1: 30 points
- +2: 45 points
- +3: 60 points
- +4: 80 points
- +5: 90 points
- +6 or more: 100 points

##Map Fairness##
During map generation, if the game determines that there is a severe imbalance in spawn positions, it will throw out the map and try again. Currently, the algorithm takes into account:

- Number of expansions each spawn point is closest to
- Elevation
- For FFA: Distance to closest opponent
- For 2v2: Distance to farthest teammate

##Balance Changes##

- Landmine: Cast time 0.25 seconds (from 0.5)
- Toad: 9 HP 6 DMG / 3 AOE (from 11 HP, 8 DMG / 2 AOE), can be denied during 0.25 second detonation time
- Skunk: 35 HP (from 32)
- Chameleon: 6 DMG (from 7)

##New Language##

- Italian
