title: "Hotfix 1.1.1.3: Drumfire Balance"
---

A little hotfix for y'all that makes a more appropriate statline for the Tier 2 Drumfire Cannon. There's also a significant Mole nerf and some fixes for the new crossplay code. Yay!

##Balance Changes##

- Mole - Dmg 2 + structure crit (was 4 + crit), HP 25 (was 15). High level players have essentially stopped using Mole because it's nigh unbeatable, so we've nerfed its statline again. Mr. Mole will still get a significant redesign at some point, while hopefully retaining his character.
- Fox - Cast time and Post-shot Root time changed from 0.3/0.3 seconds to 0.2/0.4 seconds. The fox still is rooted for 0.6 seconds but has a shorter cast time to make the animation look right.
- Artillery - HP 60 (was 45). 10 Dmg per shot with random 1 tile scatter to shots - NO AOE (was 6 + 1 AOE). Fires 4 times in 1 second, takes 1 second cooldown. (was firing 3 times in a second with 2 second cooldown). This is more fitting with the t2 pricing/timing while still accomplishing the feeling of an anti-t1 AOE.

##Bug Fixes##
Galaxy/Steam crossplay crashing issues fixed, works correctly on Windows 7.
