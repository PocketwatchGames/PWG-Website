Patch 1.1.2 is a small bug fix/balance patch with big changes to Snake and Artillery.

##Balance Changes##

- Snake - HP 27 (from 35). Can now poison structures again. Ever since we removed structure tagging, snakes have felt very flat. And since structure play is now much more viable, there needed to be more options for dealing with things like MG Turrets, Balloons, and Artillery.
- Artillery - Cost 180 (from 120), Build time 30 seconds (from 20), HP 50 (from 45). The Tier 2 Artillery was stupidly strong, and was even unbeatable in rush scenarios. Unfortunately, bumping it to the Tier 3 timing, which is now 50 seconds), meant that I suspect the unit would never get used. So I broke down and made an exception to the strict timing consistency that I've maintained for other units. It feels pretty good now, and I think will still get used quite often.

##Bug Fixes##

- Winning multiple stars in a match in ranked will now display the correct star animations.
- Multiple crashes and disconnects in Ranked games fixed.
- Crash on starting matches fixed.
