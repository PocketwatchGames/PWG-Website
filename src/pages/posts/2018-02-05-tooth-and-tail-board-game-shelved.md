title: "Tooth and Tail Board Game Shelved"
---

I'm a bit bummed about this news, but I also don't like launching stuff that isn't top notch quality. This news from board game designer, Tim Fowers, who was working on a board game adaptation of Tooth and Tail:

> I've been trying various things with Tooth and Tail and wanted to report when I made some meaningful progress, but no luck. Tried some pretty crazy stuff, like running the whole game as a roll-and-write (think yahtzee). It actually tracked the economy pretty well, but then the combat fell flat.
> So for now I'm shelving the project - I have a ton of sunk cost, but I've been stuck in design ruts with other games and kept chasing elegant solutions, but in reality I was thrashing. I'm happy to release any of the 'builds' into the community if anyone would like to do some print and play. Some of the previous builds were good, just not great. If you or anyone want to take it and develop it more, I'd be happy to help.
> Anyway, sorry for the not getting over the line with the project. If I bump into a solution later I'll let you know.

We've got plenty of other irons in the fire though! Onward!
