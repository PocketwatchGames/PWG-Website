title: "Patch 1.1.3: Diamonds are a Lizardâ€™s Best Friend"
---

Balance-wise, this patch is focused on reducing lizard spam through a fairly major lizard nerf and nerfs to both Bullet Hive and Featherwire, which have been used to establish containment chokes. Also, there's a major buff to Owl to bring her back into play.

On the single player side: Multiplayer stats have diverged significantly from single player stats since the game came out, so I moved the stat changes over to the single player campaign and rebalanced the whole darn thing in order to have a smoother difficulty curve.

##New Features##

- Players can now burrow to allied bases in 2v2

##Balance Changes##

- Lizard - 7 HP (from 8); 2 range only covers a diamond shape rather than a circle shape (slight reduction in attack range coverage at 2 range)
  ![Lizard Range](https://i.imgur.com/sAAuRWL.jpg)
- Chameleon - 38 HP (from 40)
- Boar - Flamethrower Coverage of 6 tiles (from 10); Boar bomb 5 dmg (10 to structures), no longer hits air (was 7/14, hits air)
- Owl - 1 mouse per second up to 3, 7 second reload, leading to 3 mice every 10 seconds (was 1 mouse per 5 seconds), they live for 30 seconds (was 60), mice have 7 HP (was 10)
  ![OwlSpawner](https://i.imgur.com/ZHHWTFj.gif)
- Barbed Wire - 24 HP (from 30)
- Landmine - 12 Damage, 6 AOE (from 18/6); 0.4 second trigger (from 0.5 seconds); Can target cloaked Chameleons
- Machine Gun Turret - 28 HP (from 32)
- Artillery - 60 HP (from 50)

##Bug Fixes##

- Campfires no longer push back gristmill territory as if they had gristmill-sized range
- Artillery shots no longer remove decor objects (like trees) when they miss
- Lizard no longer hang out in back, waiting for a reservation position to open up
