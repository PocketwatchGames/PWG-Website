![Patch 1.1.4](https://i.imgur.com/qbVCMtg.jpg)

Sometimes, you just have to admit you're wrong. A few of the changes that I've made over the past months haven't been received well, and I spent a lot of time trying to fix them when in fact the best thing to do is just back them out.

And because I was away for a week at GDC and I didn't have my finger on the pulse of the community, the changes in this patch are largely derived from mods that the community made -- in particular by the esteemed JetEriksen and EEluminatus.

The lizard changes from last patch are gone, and by community request, swift has been reduced from 2x speed to 1.75. This affects fox, lizard, and mouse. Boar bomb has been greatly reduced and boar has been given a modified agile: he can move at 50% speed while firing. This means that his bomb can both be buffed (to 20 DMG!) but reduced in range from a 9x9 radius to 3x3. Toad, skunk and mole changes also come directly from community modding and testing.

I've also made a couple of changes that I've wanted to do to Pigeon and Artillery. Pigeon now has less heal but a much longer range. Artillery has a slightly longer range and the bullet time scales with the distance it is firing.

We've also added German as an official language! Turkish is coming soon.
