Back when I started Pocketwatch Games in 2005, Steam wasn't selling games outside of Valve's own. XBLA didn't exist yet. Digital distribution of games was in its infancy, and sites like Big Fish Games and Yahoo were the big players, mostly selling casual games like Bejeweled and Lemonade Stand.

I left the AAA game industry to go indie, and with a small group of collaborators I made a game called Wildlife Tycoon: Venture Africa. I sold the game on those sites but also in physical form in stores like WalMart and Target, eventually selling close to 100,000 copies. It was nominated for the 2006 IGF Grand Prize, the same year that Darwinia took the top Prize and a little prototype called Braid won the Design award.

Venture Africa was not built specifically for kids, but it did find it's niche there, being sold to schools to help educate kids about ecosystems and the relationships of predators and prey.

With the follow-up, Venture Arctic, I didn't want to just reskin the gameplay -- I wanted to redesign the concept around the unique mechanics that drive Arctic ecosystems. The player takes on the role of Mother Nature, and the tools available to you change as the seasons turn.

I still have fans asking for the games, but I was no longer selling them anywhere. So I figured it was time to put them on steam. You can now buy each for $2, or $3 if you buy them together. They are older games, so don't expect them to compare to Monaco or Tooth and Tail, but if you love animals, or you have kids, or you just want to support Pocketwatch Games, please consider buying them!
