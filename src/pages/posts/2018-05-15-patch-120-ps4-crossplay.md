Tooth and Tail 1.2 has arrived! PS4 Crossplay, a new territory game that integrates with our Discord server, 4 new languages, and the biggest balance patch we've done in months. Pull up to the table, get ready to feast!

##PS4 Crossplay##
The long-awaited PS4/PC crossplay is now live, which means PS4 players can play against Steam and GOG players and vice versa. Note that the leaderboards are still segregated by platform.

##New Discord Game - Pocketworld (Beta)##
Head to the Pocketworld channel in Discord and type '!team red' (or green, blue, yellow) to declare yourself a member of a particular faction. When you play ranked matches, you'll advance that faction's territory on the map! Help your faction conquer Vyeshal and feast on your enemies!
