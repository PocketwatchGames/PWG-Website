![Patch 1.2.1](https://i.imgur.com/sQdVicg.jpg)

With a big patch in the rearview and a couple of big patches on the horizon, it was time for a small balance patch with a few quality of life improvements and bug fixes.

## Balance Changes

- Gristmill starting health reduced to 7.5 HP (was 22.5). Added a 1 second sell timer
- Campfires must now be stood upon to build them. This allows you to build moles and landmines next to them without having to build them.
- Unit collision radius reduced to 0.4 tile radius (was 0.5) - this was done to improve retreating -- units in the rear don't get pushed back quite so much. You may notice units will tend to bunch up a little more!
- Squirrel - 0.4 second movement freeze after shooting (was 0.25), 0.25 second cast time, 0.75 second cooldown (was 0 second cast, 1 second cooldown)
- Mole - 21 HP (was 20)
- Chameleon - 38 HP (was 36)
- Falcon - 16 HP (was 15)
- Snake - 30 HP (was 28)
- Balloon - 3 second reload, 15 damage per shot (was 2 second reload, 14 damage per shot)

## New Features

- Streamer Mode option removes the button hints from the bottom of the screen while spectating or watching replays, and hides the match progress bar behind the match time
- Holding the analog stick in a direction during menu navigation will scroll more quickly

## Bug Fixes

- Targeting highlight in 2v2 fixed
- Increased frequency of stormy and hail weather types in multiplayer
- Discord Rich Presence fixed on Mac
- Decreased VRAM usage
- Looping campfire/machine gun sound after match end fixed
