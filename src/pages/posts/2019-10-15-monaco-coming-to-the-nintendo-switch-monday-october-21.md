I've been asked the question countless times... "Is Monaco coming to the Switch?" "When is Monaco gonna be on the Switch?" "Please wink at me if Monaco is coming to the Switch."

Well...

Monaco is coming to the Switch. I'm calling it Monaco: Complete Edition because it comes with all the post-launch content added to the PC version after launch: A Survival campaign, detailing the origin stories of each of the thieves, a brutal Epilogue campaign that ties up the loose ends of the epic heist story, and a zombie mode, allowing you to play through the entire game again with the guards replaced by a variety of brain-eating zombies.

We've got Sickhead Games to thank for the port (the guys responsible for the PS4 port of Tooth and Tail). They did an amazing job.

The Switch version supports couch co-op, local networked play (multiple devices playing on a local network over wifi), and of course online play. Play with controller in any configuration, including one player on each joy con.

If you are press and you want a review copy, please reach out to me via twitter at @PocketwatchGames or @AndySchatz. And for everyone else, get ready for MonacoMonday on Monday, October 21st!
