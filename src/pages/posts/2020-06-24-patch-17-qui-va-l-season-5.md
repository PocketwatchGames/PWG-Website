French localization, the ability to reveal cloaked enemies, and a ladder reset - these are the headliners of this patch. We also threw some small balance tweaks in the mix, mainly to make poking and siege strategies stronger, and added a few minor fixes and features.

### Season 5

All ranked points have been reset to zero, again, season 5 has started!
Eight players managed to get beyond 1000 points, this season:
Congrats to Arilou, Gent, James, Imari, QQ, Melvinfro, Jakobi, and mocaccino!

### Multiplayer Balance/Gameplay Changes

![p1620_reveal.png](https://i.imgur.com/uOPvlYG.gif "Reveal cloaked enemies with your commander!")

- **Commander:** After standing still for a short time, any other team's cloaked units and structures in a 3x3 area around the commander will be forced to uncloak for 1s. (Rallying allowed, burrowing resets the timer.) Visualization as seen in the GIF is off by default, but can be turned on in options (other).
- **Toad:** Moves at the same speed on all kinds of terrain; still slowed down by Barbed Wire, Daze etc.
- **Pigeon:** 4 tiles range (from 3).
- **Ferret:** 6 DPS (from 5 DPS), 6 tiles vision range (from 5 tiles).
- **Chameleon:** 32 HP (from 34 HP).
- **Badger:** Rev up in 5s (from 6s) and rev down in 3s (from 2s).
- **Wolf:** Buffs units for 10s (from 12s).
- \*_Fox:_ 12 DPS (from 11 DPS), 25 HP (from 24 HP), 6 tiles vision range (from 5 tiles).
- **Barbed Wire:** 16 HP (from 18 HP).
- **Landmine:** Gets triggered at 1 tile distance, again (from 0 tiles = same tile), 16 damage against a single target (from 18), including 2 damage in a 3x3 area (unchanged).
- **Machinegun:** 28 HP (from 24 HP).
- **Artillery:** 6 tiles vision range (from 5 tiles).
- Lower max. amount of water on **Old Mother Township** maps.

### Localization

Thanks to The Gentleman, we can add another language to the game: **French localization** is now available!

![p1620_zqsd.png](https://i.imgur.com/Utb3syE.png "French localization and better AZERTY support.")

Some players also notified me that the game partially handled keyboard inputs in a strange way: Despite using the correct localization in the menus, the game assumed a QWERTY layout as soon as you started playing. That issue is fixed, now. However, you might have to rebind your keys in case you are using an AZERTY layout (for example) with the original key mapping (WASD for movement).

### Graphics Options

You can now make the **Fog of War visible on your Minimap.** In the Graphics Options, you'll see "Fog of War on the Minimap". It is off by default, but can be turned on in Graphics Options.

Some systems have been heavily slowed down when certain **lighting options** (especially bloom) were active, allowing them to play only on low quality graphics. These lighting options will from now on only be active in high and ultra settings, so if they caused you any trouble, you can enjoy the lighting and shadows of the medium settings, instead of having to choose low quality.

### Fixes

**Fragile Wire on Custom Maps:** Barbed Wire placed next to decor assigned to a different faction* took way too much damage when touched. Only happened on custom maps, should be fixed, now.
*) Faction-aligned decor is mostly useless, anyway, will no longer occur on new custom maps.

Some (rare) crashes should be fixed, too - just keep telling me if something bad happens!

### Community News

We've had a couple of events since the last update, first of all the **TnT Championship 2020.1** - a league with three divisions (beginner, intermediate, premier) and over 50 participants. Well played, everyone!
Since the Championship has been casted by different streamers over several weeks, we do not have a complete collection of all the matches, but [here are most of the (near) final games.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj08hbMppqzf8Bt7oMfM9JA) There will probably be a second installment of the Championship in autumn.

We also had a continuation of Gent's famous series of tournaments with special rules, this time: **The 21 Clues!** All participants could gather and exchange information that helped them pick their targets in four challenges: smuggling contraband (Longcoats), raiding meat hoarders (Commonfolk), catching the assassin (KSR) or preparing the perfect feast, by cooking an enemy with a special "recipe" (Civilized). After catching the assassin and raiding the most meat, Arilou won over the three other finalists: Melvinfro, Mishi (best cooking), and Cyanide Trick (best smuggling).
[The finals have been casted by Delthius and JetEriksen on ToothAndTailTV.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/649839862)

Delthius also recently celebrated the 100th Episode of his replay casting show **The Feast** (on [ToothAndTailTV](https://www.twitch.tv/toothandtailtv), as well) with a wacky tournament, that allowed only Fox, Turret and Artillery Cannon in each player's deck.

The **next tournament is going to be the 2v2's Bizarre Adventure**, on June 20th, 1pm EDT / 5pm GMT. Each team will consist of one experienced and one learning player, and the experienced player will be assigned one of several pre-defined "bad decks"... only their team mate can save them.
[The comfortably short rules can be found here!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IdrjIHdvkuznr8sct537gupHNPwsaJJIuc3oevEUVfU/edit)

Salut et bonne bataille !
