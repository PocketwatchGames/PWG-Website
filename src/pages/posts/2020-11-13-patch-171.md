# Patch 1.7.1: Vyeshal Ventures

![Vyeshal Ventures](https://i.imgur.com/BVqxPxs.png)

This patch comes with three new languages (Ukrainian, Esperanto, and Dutch) as well as a couple of balance tweaks to make certain playstyles a bit more risky. Most importantly: Barbed Wire no longer heals and Mole Warrens even deteriorate, so they keep most of their strength, but you better make it count!
See all the details about this and some other, small improvements below.

### Multiplayer Balance

- **Pig:** 18 HP (from 20 HP).
- **Toad:** moves at the speed of regular units on roads (x1.3), on all terrain types.
- **Mole:** Warren to 18 HP (from 25 HP), and the Warren loses 3 HP whenever a Mole spawns from it.
- **Chameleon:** can attack immediately after uncloaking (from 0.25s delay).
- **Barbed Wire:** 14 HP (from 16 HP), start building with 1 HP (from 2.5 HP).
- **Barbed Wire, Landmine, and Mole Warren:** never regenerate HP.
- **All Structures:** cure poison on themselves even outside territory (poison used to get cured only in territory).
- **Stealth Reveal:** Commander needs to stand still for 2s (from 1.2s). Changed visualization and audio. Enemy commanders will **not** see the highlighted tiles or hear the sound effect.

### Other Improvements and Fixes

- Shared replays now also work if they have been played on Workshop Maps.
- Mice no longer regenerate HP while being attacked (which was particularly bad in Story Mode missions where water heals, e.g. Sage Marro Speaks).
- Increased the impact of the difficulty slider for Awash in Solawa (Food gain per kill now depends on difficulty) and Vacancee Downfall (enemy has more/less resources depending on difficulty).
- Fixed the localization of summoned unit names in Story Mode.

### Localization

The game can now also be played in Ukrainian, Esperanto, and Dutch!

### Community News

End of July, the Tooth and Tail **Championship 2020.2** started with almost 60 players.
It ended in September with these winners:
**Premier division:** Arilou (1st), The Gentleman (2nd), mocaccino (3rd)
**Intermediate division:** Sulomon (1st), Trumpet (2nd), Satoros (3rd)
**Beginner division:** elverdulerojorge (1st), Kin_Replica (2nd), Horus The Holy (3rd)

Shortly after that, **The Magnificent 21** started: a team-based tournament with a lot of flavor, deck restrictions, and advantages for less experienced players.
See [The Magnificent Gazette](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2267446981) for weekly reports on the tournament!
In the end, the Badger Brothers barely defeated the Kasha Agency in the Grand Finals!

Mocaccino, the main organizer of the Championship, recently started a **Pre-Season Cup**, and more events are planned, e.g. another Boss Rush tournament (like 21 Duels), more seasons and spinoffs of the Championship as well as another 2v2 tournament early next year.
