Please welcome Lee Dotson as Pocketwatch’s new art director!

Lee has had a long career in games, going back to his work at Ion Storm, Blizzard, Epic Games, and most recently Harebrained Schemes. He’s fluent in pretty much all disciplines and has a strong technical background as well.

The thing that we’re most excited about with Lee is his unique personal vision. Though we’ve had the good fortune to work with many talented artists over the years, this will be the first time Pocketwatch has been able to have an in-house art director guiding our project’s aesthetic vision from such an early stage. Lee’s personal work is both dark and whimsical, highly technical yet wildly imaginative, and his professional work has the range of a true journeyman.

Lee’s arrival marks the start of a new chapter for Pocketwatch, and we can’t wait to explore the worlds which will spring forth from his mind.
