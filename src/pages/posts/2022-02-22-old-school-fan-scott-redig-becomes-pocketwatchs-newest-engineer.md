Scott first heard of Pocketwatch back in 2010, when a video of Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine was posted on Bytejacker. Monaco had just been nominated for the Independent Games Festival. He quickly became a part of the game's nascent community, contributing to our open development in a variety of ways. A few years later, he even visited us at the Game Developer Conference.

After graduating from college, Scott went to Google, and now, I'm proud to say, he has found a home here at Pocketwatch.

Scott, has a particularly nimble mind and a deep knowledge of modern game design. I couldn't be more proud to bring this OG fan -- this old friend -- on board the growing Pocketwatch team.
